I'm about to break.
I need a little room to breathe.
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge.
And I'm about to break.
.
I'm about to break.
This room to breathe.
This room to breathe.
This room to breathe.
.
I cannot take this anymore.
Saying everything I've said before.
All these words, they make no sense.
I found bliss in ignorance.
Less I hear, the less you say.
You'll find that out anyway.
I find the answers aren't so clear.
Wish I could find a way to disappear.
All these thoughts, they make no sense.
I found bliss in ignorance.
Nothing seems to go away.
Over and over again.
Just like before.
.
Everything you say to me.
And I'm about to break.
I need a little room to breathe.
And I'm about to break.
.
Everything you say to me.
And I'm about to break.
I need a little room to breathe.
And I'm about to break.
.
These are the places where I can feel torn from my body.
My flesh, it peels during this ride we can cut upwhat we like.
I'm about to break.
Waiting alone, I cannot resist.
Feeling this hate, I have never missed.
Please, someone, give me a reason to rip off my face.
Blood is a pouring.
And pouring.
And pouring.
And pouring.
And pouring.
And pouring.
And pouring.
And pouring.
And pouring.
And pouring.

Shut up when I'm talking to you.

Blood is pouring.

Everything you say to me.
And I'm about to break.

Everything you say to me.
Takes me one step closer to the edge.

Man, the other day.
I was trying to figure out how many letters was in the alphabet.
It took me all day, but you know I did it.
You wanna know how many letters there are?.
26 letters in the alphabet!.
.
26 letters in the alphabet.
I wear a shower cap so I don't get wet.
I put on my shoes so my feet don't hurt.
And go to the floor with Ernie and Bert.
.
When I'm on the floor, I'm singin'.
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
When I'm on the floor, I'm singin'.
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
.
I got lots of friends, so I don't need pets.

Ernie got wasted and Bert went flat.
They got kicked out and they can't come back.
.
So they're standing outside, singin'.
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
Yeah, they're standing outside, singin'.
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
.
Yeah, you know they outside.

Do the Ernie (Who's inside?).

Shake your milky (Who's upside?).
Chocolate shirt (Who's downside?).

.
Man, I didn't know I was so smart...my brain hurts.
My brain hurts!.
.
.
.
.
.
Nah, you don't know me.
Lightning above and a fire below me.
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me.
You cannot stop, much less control me.
When it rains, it pours, when the floodgates open brace your shores.
That pressure don't care when it breaks your doors.
Say it's all you can take, better take some more.
.
(Oh).
'Cause I know what it's like to test fate.
Had my shoulders pressed with that weight.
Stood up strong in spite of that hate.
.
(Oh).
Night gets darkest right before dawn.
What don't kill you makes you more strong.
And I been waiting for it so long.
.
The nights go on.
Waiting for a light that never comes.
I chase the sun.
Waiting for a light that never comes.
.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Waiting for a light that never comes.
.
When I was young, they told me, they said.
Make your bed, you lie in that bed.
A king can only reign 'til instead.
There comes that day it's "off with his head".
.
(Oh).
The night gets darkest right before dawn.
What don't kill you makes you more strong.
You'll have my mercy then when you're gone.
.
The nights go on.
Waiting for a light that never comes.
I chase the sun.
Waiting for a light that never comes.
.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Waiting for a light that never comes.

And I told them, nah, you don't know me.
Lightning above and a fire below me.
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me.
You cannot stop, much less control me.
When it rains, it pours.
When the floodgates open, brace your shores.
That pressure don't care, it breaks your doors.

Today, we stood on the wall.
We laughed at the sun.
We laughed at the guns.
We laughed at it all.
And when they.
They told us to go.
We paid them no mind.
Like every other time.
But little did we know.
.
Today, I looked for a sign.
With flames in my hands.
A line in the sand.
Between yours and mine.
And it came like fire from below.
Your greed led the call, my flag had to fall.
But little did you know.
.
Another day, your truth will come.
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done.
You'll get what's yours and face your crime.
You'll tell them give me back what's mine.
Give me back what's mine.
.
I had never been a coward.
I had never seen blood.
You had sold me an ocean.
And I was lost in the flood.
We were counting on a leader.
We were driven by need.
But couldn't take temptation.
And we were blinded by greed.
You were steady as a sniper.
We were waiting on a wire.
So we never saw it coming.
When you ran from the fire.
You can try intimidation.
And you can try to ignore.
But when the time comes calling.
Yeah, you are gonna get yours.
.
Another day, your truth will come.
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done.
You'll get what's yours and face your crime.
You'll tell them give me back what's mine.
Give me back what's mine.
.
And so today, your truth has come.
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done.
You'll get what's yours, you're out of time.
And you will give me back what's mine.
Give me back what's mine.
Give me, give me back what's mine.
What's mine.
Give me, give me back what's mine.
What's mine, what's mine.
Give me back what's mine.
.
Today, we stood on the wall.
We laughed at the sun.
We laughed at the guns.
We laughed at it all.
And when they.
They told us to go.
We paid them no mind.
Like every other time.
But little did we know.

I watch how the moon.
sits in the sky in the dark night.
Shining with the light from the sun.
And the sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming.
The moon's going to owe it one.
It makes me think of how you act to me.
You do.
Favors and then rapidly, you just.
Turn around and start asking me about.
Things you want back from me.
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger.
Sick of you acting like I owe you this.
Find another place to feed your greed.
While I find a place to rest.
I want to be in another place.
I hate when you say you don't understand.
(You'll see it's not meant to be).
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy.
A place for my head.
.
Maybe someday I'll be just like you and.
Step on people like you do and.
Run away the people I thought I knew.
I remember back then who you were.
You used to be calm used to be strong.
Used to be generous but you should've known.
That you'd.
Wear out your welcome now you see.
How quiet it is all alone.
I'm so.
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger.
Sick of you acting like I owe you this.
Find another place to feed your greed.
While I find a place to rest.
I'm so.
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger.
Sick of you acting like I owe you this.
Find another place to feed your greed.
While I find a place to rest.
.
I want to be in another place.
I hate when you say you don't understand.
(You'll see it's not meant to be).
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy.
A place for my head.
.
You try to take the best of me.
Go away.
You try to take the best of me.
Go away.
You try to take the best of me.
Go away.
You try to take the best of me.
Go away.
You try to take the best of me.
Go away.
You try to take the best of me.
Go away.
You try to take the best of me.
Go away.
You try to take the best of me.
Go away.

I want to be in another place.
I hate when you say you don't understand.
(You'll see it's not meant to be).
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy.
A place for my head.
.
Shut up.

I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger.
Sick of you acting like I owe you this.
Find another place to feed your greed.
While I find a place to rest.
.
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger.
Sick of you acting like I owe you this.
Find another place, to feed your greed.
While I find a place to rest.

[The Requiem].
God save us everyone.
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns.
For the sins of our hands.
Sins of our tongue.
Sins of our father.
The sins of our young.

God save us everyone.

[The Radiance].
"We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty, and to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form, and says, 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.".
[Burning in the skies].
I use the deadwood to make the fire rise.
The blood of innocence burning in the skies.
I filled my cup with the rising of the sea.
And poured it out in an ocean of debris.
.
I'm swimming in the smoke.
Of bridges I have burned.
So don't apologize.
I'm losing what I don't deserve.
What I don't deserve.
.
I held my breath as clouds began to form.
But you were lost in the beating of the storm.
But in the end we were meant to be apart.
Like separate chambers of the human heart.
.
I'm swimming in the smoke.
Of bridges I have burned.
So don't apologize.
I'm losing what I don't deserve.
.
It's in the blackened bones.
Of bridges I have burned.
So don't apologize.
I'm losing what I don't deserve.
What I don't deserve.
.
I'm swimming in the smoke.
Of bridges I have burned.
So don't apologize.
I'm losing what I don't deserve.
.
The blame is mine alone.
For bridges I have burned.
So don't apologize.
I'm losing what I don't deserve.
.
What I don't deserve.
What I don't deserve.
What I don't deserve.
.
I use the deadwood to make the fire rise.
The blood of innocence burning in the skies.
.
[When they come for me].
I am not a pattern to be followed.
The pill that I'm on is a tough one to swallow.
I'm not a criminal, not a role model.
Not a born leader, I'm a tough act to follow.
I am not the fortune and the fame.
Or the same person telling you to forfeit the game.
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain.
And found out the underbelly's sicker than it seems.
And it seems ugly but it can get worse.
Because even a blueprint is a gift and a curse.
Because once you got a theory of how the thing works.
Everybody wants the next thing to be like the first.
And I'm not a robot, I'm not a monkey.
I will not dance even if the beat's funky.
Opposite of lazy, far from a punk.
Ya'll ought to stop talking and start trying to catch up motherfucker.
.
And all the people say.
Try and catch up motherfucker.
.
Lauren said money changes situation.
Big said it increase the complication.
Kane said don't step I ain't the one.
Chuck said an uzi weighs a motherfucking tone.
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me.
Rocking every stage in every place that they brought me.
I'm awfully underrated but came here to correct it.
And so it ain't mistaken I'm gonna state it for the record.
I am the opposite of wack, opposite of weak.
Opposite of slack synonym of heat.
synonym of crack, closest to a beat.
Far from a punk.
Ya'll ought to stop talking and start trying to catch up motherfucker.
.
And all the people say.
Try and catch up motherfucker.
.
But when they come for me.
Come for me, I'm gone.
But when they come for me.
Come for me, I'm gone.
But when they come for me.
Come for me, I'll be gone.
.
And all the people say.
Try to catch up motherfucker.
And all the people say.
Try to catch up motherfucker.
.
[Robot boy].
You say you're not going to fight.
Because no one will fight for you.
That you think there's not enough love.
And no one to give it to.
That your sure you've hurt for so long.
You've got nothing left to lose.
You say your not going to fight.
Because no one will fight for you.
.
You say the weight of the world.
Has kept you from letting go.
And you think compassion's a flaw.
But you'll never let it show.
And your sure you've hurt in a way.
That no one will ever know.
But someday the weight of the world.
Will give you strength to go.
.
Hold on the weight of the world.
Will give you the strength to go.
So hold on the weight of the world.
Will give you the strength to go.
So hold on the weight of the world.
Will give you the strength to go.
Just hold on the weight of the world.
Will give you the strength to go.
.
[Waiting for the end].
This is not the end, this is not the beginning.
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision.
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm.
Though the words sound steady something's empty within them.
We say yeah with fists flying up in the air.
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there.
Because we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear.
Until we dead it, forget it let it all disappear.
.
Waiting for the end to come.
Wishing I had strength to stand.
This is not what I had planned.
It's out of my control.
Flying at the speed of light.
Thoughts were spinning in my head.
So many things were left unsaid.
It's hard to let you go.
.
I know what it takes to move on.
I know how it feels to lie.
All I want to do.
Is trade this life for something new.
Holding on to what I haven't got.
.
Sitting in an empty room.
Trying to forget the past.
This wasn't meant to last.
I wish it wasn't so.
.
I know what it takes to move on.
I know how it feels to lie.
All I want to do.
Is trade this life for something new.
Holding on to what I haven't got.
.
What was left when that fire was gone.
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong.
All caught up in the eye of the storm.
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on.
And I don't even what kind of things I said.
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead.
So I'm picking up the pieces, now where to begin.
The hardest part of ending is starting again.
.
All I want to do.
Is trade this life for something new.
Holding onto what I haven't got.
I'm holding on to what I haven't got.
I'm holding on to what I haven't got.
.
This is not the end, this is not the beginning.
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision.

[Blackout].
I'm stuck in this bed you made.
Alone with this sinking feeling.
I saw through the words you said.
To the secrets you've been keeping.
It's written upon your face.
All the lies how they cut so deeply.
You can't get enough.
You take and take and take.
And never say no.
.
You got to get it inside.
You push it back down.
You push it back down.
No.
You'll never get it inside.
You push it back down.
Blackout.
Blood in your eye.
.
You say that it's not your fault.
And swear that I am mistaken.
You said it's not what it seems.
No remorse for the trust your breaking.
You run to the back you fall.
Suffocate in the mess your making.
You can't get enough.
You take and take and take and take and take.
Fuck it are you listening.
.
No.
You got to get it inside.
You push it back down.

Floating out as colors fill the light.
We look up from the ground in fields of paper white.
Floating up you pass us in the night.
The future gazing out a past to overwrite.
.
So come down far below.
We've been waiting to collect the things you know.
Come down far below.
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go.

Come down.
Come down.
Come down.
Come down.

[Wretches and kings].
.
To save face.
How low can you go.
Talk a lot of game but yet you don't know.
Fire on the way make us all say whoa.
The people up top push the people down low.
Get down and obey every word.
Steady get in line if you haven't yet heard.
Want to take what I got don't be absurd.
Don't fight the power and nobody gets hurt.
If you haven't heard yet than I'm letting you know.
There ain't shit we don't run when guns unload.
And no one make a move unless my people say so.
Got everything under control.
Now everybody go.
.
Steel unload, final blow.
We the animals take control.
Hear us now, clear and true.
Wretches and kings.
We come for you.

So keep pace.
How slow can you go.
Talk a lot of shit and yet you don't know.
Fire on the way make you all say whoa.
The people up top and the people down low.
Get down and I'm running it like that.
The front of the attack is exactly where I'm at.
Somewhere in between the kick and the hi-hat.
The pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact.
So get with the combat.
I'm letting them know.
There ain't shit you can say to make me back down low.
So push the button and the whole thing blows.
Spinning everything out of control.
Now everybody go.
.
Steel unload, final blow.
We the animals take control.
Hear us now, clear and true.
Wretches and kings.
We come for you.

Steel unload, final blow.
Filthy animals beat them low.
Skin and bone, black and blue.
No more this sun shall beat onto you.

From the front to back.
And the side to side.
If you fear what I feel.
Put them up real high.

[Wisdom, Justice, and Love].
"I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight because my conscience leaves me no other choice... A true revolution of values will lay hand on the world order and say of war, 'This way of settling differences is not just.' This business of burning human beings with napalm, of filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love...".
.
[Iridescent].
You were standing in the wake of devastation.
You were waiting on the edge of the unknown.
With the cataclysm raining down.
Inside's crying save me now.
You were there impossibly alone.
.
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation.
You build up hope but failure's all you've known.
Remember all the sadness and frustration.
And let it go.
Let it go.
.
And in a burst of light that blinded every angel.
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stone.
You felt the gravity of tempered grace.
Falling into empty space.
No one there to catch in their arms.

When you feel all alone.
Cut off from this cruel world.
Your instincts tell you to run.
Listen to your heart.
Those angel voices.
They'll sing to you.
They'll be your guide back home.

When life leaves us blind.
Love keeps us kind.
It keeps us kind.

When you've suffered enough.
And your spirit is breaking.
Your growing desperate from the fight.
Remember your love.
And you always will be.
This melody will bring you right back home.

When life leaves us blind.
Love keeps us kind.
When life leaves us blind.
Love keeps us kind.
.
.
In this desert, in darkness.
Lying with the gun across his chest.
Pretending his heartless.
As the fire flashes in the sky.
He was fragile and frozen.
When the bullet took away his friend.
.
His pulling his weapons to aside.
Loading his bullet-kiss goodbyes.
Holding an enemy across the line.
His pulling his weapons to aside.
Loading his bullet-kiss goodbyes.
Holding an enemy across the line.
.
Sweating and shaking.
Lying with her hands across her chest.
She wakes with her cravings.
As the fire flashes in her eye.
She was fragile and frozen.
When the needle took away her friend.
But now she's somehow more broken.
.
She's pulling her weapons to aside.
Loading her bulletproof advise.
Holding an enemy across the line.
She's pulling her weapons to aside.
Loading her bulletproof advise.
Holding an enemy across the line.
.
With every battle his choosing.
With every bye his loosing.
His enemy is not far behind.
With every promise she's broken.
With every lie she's spoken.
Her enemy's not far behind.
.
It's your time.
It's your time.
It's your time.
It's your time.
.
His pulling his weapons to aside.
Loading his bullet-kiss goodbyes.
Holding an enemy across the line.
She's pulling her weapons to aside.
Loading her bulletproof advise.
Holding an enemy across the line.
.
With every battle his choosing.
With every bye his loosing.
His enemy is not far behind.
With every promise she's broken.
With every lie she's spoken.
Her enemy's not far behind.

So what 'cha waiting for.
Anticipating more.
While you debate what it could take to instigate a war.
Yeah I been hated more than time I wasn't hated for.
There's nothing they can fucking say they didn't say before.
But you could never see it.
Your battle's not mine.
Wanna skate and play it safe but this is take a shot time.
While you're waiting for a purpose I already got mine.
While you tell me step to it like 1, 2, 3, 4.
.
And if I do what you demand.
(You say) You'll let me understand.
(You say) You're gonna hold me to your word.
And if I sell myself away.
(You say) I'll have no debt to pay.
(You say) I'm gonna get what I deserve.
Woah.
.
YOUR WORD / OBEYED.
MY DEBT / REPAID.
OUR TRUST / BETRAYED.
ALL FOR NOTHING.
ALL FOR NOTHING.
.
Kick back there's no other way to say it.
So let me break this fucker down for ya.
I really don't know ya.
You talk but let me show ya where to put your paranoia.
You're joking, I don't have a half a sucker bone to throw ya.
I'm disgusted, wonder what could've made ya tuck your tail below ya.
And no I'm not your soldier I'm not taking any orders.
I'm a five star general, infantry controller.
Need a lesson?  Let me show ya.
Have you checking your composure.
While I make you step to it like 1, 2, 3, 4.
.
And if I do what you demand.
(You say) You'll let me understand.
(You say) You're gonna hold me to your word.
And if I sell myself away.
(You say) I'll have no debt to pay.
(You say) I'm gonna get what I deserve.
Woah.
.
And if I do what you demand,.
You'll let me understand..
.
YOUR WORD / OBEYED.
MY DEBT / REPAID.
OUR TRUST / BETRAYED.
ALL FOR NOTHING.
ALL FOR NOTHING.
ALL FOR NOTHING.
OH.
.
.
This is the first line here,.
This is the first line again..
Watch as it disappear..
I know the last line,.
The last line will never pull me in..
.
This is the second line here,.
This is the second line again..
Why does it feel like fear?.
As if the last line,.
The last line is slowly closing in..
.
Oh.
[x4].
.
This is the last line here,.
This is the last line again..
Watch as I disappear..
And the last line,.
The flat line that goes here at the end..
.
.
Where should I start.
Disjointed heart.
I've got no commitment.
To my own flesh and blood.
Left all alone.
Far from my home.
No one to hear me, to heal my ill heart, I.
.
Keep it locked up inside.
.
Cannot express.
To the point I've regressed.
If anger's a gift, then I guess I've been blessed, I.
.
Keep it locked up inside.
Keep my distance from your lies.
.
It's too late to love me now.
You helped me to show me.
It's too late to love me now.
You don't even know me.
.
Breaking a part of my heart to find release.
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace.
Breaking a part of my heart to find release.
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace.
.
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Break).
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (Me).
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Too).
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace.
.
Keep it locked up inside.
Keep my distance from your lies.
.
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Break).
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (Me).
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Too).
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace.
Breaking a part of my heart to find release.
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace.
Breaking a part of my heart to find release.
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace.
.
Keep my distance.
Keep my distance.
Keep my distance.
Keep my distance.
.
.
Spit drips in the jar, the witless witness.
Cryptic code, realism shifts your mystic.
Dark all I do embark the shadows,.
Involved with my thought catalogue, analogue, rap catalogue.
Keep my distance, answer your resistance, hurt by persistance.
The twisted web of tangled lies strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste.
And I'm forced to face these hate crimes against the state of being.
Feeling the weightlessness pressing between the ceiling, reeling around room,.
Riding a bubble of sound proof, it's the frequency making you.
Shake-shake with every boom.
Involuntary muscle contraction, ignoring and drinking musical gas field euphoria.
The sound counts to make the dead to have you a head rush with red thoughts and said stuff..
.
.
This is where the pain comes from.
This is how the payback sounds.
This is why the fire goes up.
This is why the walls come down.
You ain't never been in these shoes.
Never know the word that I'm saying.
So the only thing to keep the blood flowing.
Is to let you know I'm not playing.
.
I'ma see your lies exposed.
I'ma see the justice done.
I'ma see the sun come back.
I'ma see the kingdom come.
Take it where it can't come back.
Take it where the shadow's been.
Take it to the breaking point.
Take it to the end.
.
You're saying that the end is near.
God, you have no idea.
Used to be afraid but now.
Only thing I fear is fear.
And this is where the line gets drawn.
Something that you've always known.
This is what you're hiding from.
Truth is, I was never yours to hold.
.
Give me back the fire I had.
Give me back the faith I lost.
Give me back the trust you broke.
Give me back the pride it cost.
Take the venom out of my blood.
Take the pain you put me in.
Take it when I tell you so.
Take it to the end.
.
.
.
.
[backwards]: You should brush your teeth.
and.
You should wash your hands [x4].
.
.
I got a long way to go.
And a long memory.
I've been searching for an answer.
Always just out of reach.
.
Blood on the floor.
Sirens repeat.
I've been searching for the courage.
To face my enemies.
.
When they turn down the lights.
I hear my battle symphony.
All the world in front of me.
If my armor breaks.
I'll fuse it back together.
.
Battle symphony.
Please just don't give up on me.
And my eyes are wide awake.
.
For my battle symphony.
For my battle symphony.
.
They say that I don't belong.
Say that I should retreat.
That I'm marching to the rhythm.
Of a lonesome defeat.
But the sound of your voice.
Puts the pain in reverse.
No surrender, no illusions.
And for better or worse.
.
When they turn down the lights.
I hear my battle symphony.
All the world in front of me.
If my armor breaks.
I'll fuse it back together.
.
Battle symphony.
Please just don't give up on me.
And my eyes are wide awake.
.
If I fall.
Get knocked down.
Pick myself up off the ground.
.
If I fall.
Get knocked down.
Pick myself up off the ground.
.
When they turn down the lights.
I hear my battle symphony.
All the world in front of me.
If my armor breaks.
I'll fuse it back together.
.
Battle symphony.
Please just don't give up on me.
And my eyes are wide awake.
.
For my battle symphony.
For my battle symphony.
.
.
Your, lies.
.
Yeah.
I didn't think that I had a debt to pay.
'Til they came to take all I had left away.
You said you wouldn't put me to the test today.
But I remember you saying that yesterday.
There was a time when your mind wasn't out of control.
Every memory and confession pouring out of your soul.
Like a pill you couldn't swallow and it swallowed you whole.
Another lie hard to follow 'til followed you home.
.
And like that.
Broken down.
A victim of your.
.
Lies.
You hide behind.
Lies.
You don't know.
Why.
You crossed the line.
Wrapped up inside your.
Lies.
You hide behind.
Lies.
You're lost inside.
That cold disguise.
Behind your.
Lies.
.
I don't know what you thought I might say.
Seems like we never would talk the right way.
Every other minute I fought for my place.
And drop what I made, and thought you might stay so.
I'm guessing that you probably know.
When your inside's hollow then you want to be cold.
Like a pill I couldn't swallow and it swallowed me whole.
Another lie hard to follow 'til followed me home.
.
And like that.
Broken down.
A victim of your.
.
Lies.
You hide behind.
Lies.
You don't know.
Why.
You crossed the line.
Wrapped up inside your.
Lies.
You hide behind.
Lies.
You're lost inside.
That cold disguise.
Behind your.
Lies.
.
You're faking, you're mistaken.
If you think that you could climb out of this hole.
Forsaken, what we take with.
Analyzing by the power of control.
.
Broken down.
A victim of your.
.
Lies.
You hide behind.
Lies.
You don't know.
Why.
You hide behind.
Lies.
You don't know.
Why.
You hide behind.
Lies.
You don't know.
Why.
You hide behind.
.
Wrapped up inside your.
Lies.
You hide behind.
Lies.
You don't know.
Why.
You crossed the line.
Wrapped up inside your.
Lies.
You hide behind.
Lies.
You're lost inside.
That cold disguise.
Behind your.
Lies.
.
.
Sleep,.
In the shadows,.
Breathe,.
In the air.
.
Without dreaming.
Without a care, oh.
.
Look,.
In the mirror.
Cry,.
No control.
I've got a fever.
I've got my whole, oh.
.
(Chorus).
I tried to believe it.
Tried to receive it.
With eyes of power.
Will you deceive me, oh.
.
Crawl,.
Up to the clouds.
Claw,.
Your way out.
I want to be there.
I want to move on, oh.
.
(Chorus).
I ran like a coward.
Far from this place.
Show me desire.
Show me disgrace.
.
Believe me.
.
.
Hahaha.
You're wasting your talent, Randy.
.
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back.
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head.
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within.
It's like the face inside is right.
.
Why does it feel like night today?.
Something in here's not right today.
Why am I so uptight today?.
Paranoia's all I got left.
I don't know what stressed me first.
Or how the pressure was fed.
But I know just what it feels like.
To have a voice in the back of my head.
It's like a face that I hold inside.
A face that awakes when I close my eyes.
A face watches every time I lie.
A face that laughs every time I fall.
And watches everything.
.
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim.
That the face inside is hearing me.
Right beneath my skin.
.
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back.
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head.
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within.
It's like the face inside is right.
.
You know I - thug em, fuck em, love em, leave em.
Cause I don't fuckin' need em.
Take em out the hood, keep em lookin' good.
But I don't fuckin' feed em.
First time they fuss I'm breezin'.
Talkin' bout, "What's the reasons?".
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word, bitch.
Better trust than believe em.
In the cut where I keep em.
Til I need a nut, til I need to beat the guts.
Then it's, beep beep and I'm pickin' em up.
Let em play with the dick in the truck.
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs.
Divorce him and split his bucks.
Just because you got good head, I'ma break bread.
So you can be livin' it up? Shit I.
Parts with nothin', y'all be frontin'.
Me give my heart to a woman?.
Not for nothin', never happen.
I'll be forever mackin'.
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion.
I got no patience.
And I hate waitin.
Hoe get yo' ass in.
.
And let's ri-i-i-i-i-ide check em out now.
Ri-i-i-i-i-ide, yeah.
And let's ri-i-i-i-i-ide check em out now.
Ri-i-i-i-i-ide, yeah.
.
We doin, big pimpin', we spendin' G's.
Check em out now.
Big pimpin', on B.L.A.D.'s.
We doin big pimpin' up in N.Y.C..
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N-B.
Yo yo yo, big pimpin', spendin G's.
We doin, big pimpin', on B.L.A.D.'s.
We doin, big pimpin' up in N.Y.C..
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N-B.
.
.
Drop that get up.
Take it to the streets better lock that kid up.
Face full of teeth when you hock that spit up.
Pacing the beat like a beast.
Rocking the block on repeat.
Speak from the cut like a rush of blood.
Paint red on the sleeves of the ones you love.
Lay the sick ones down and the bells will ring.
Put pennies on the eyes, let the dead men sing.
.
I shiver and shake the warm air cold.
I'm alone on my own.
In every mistake I dig this hole.
Through my skin and bones.
It's harder starting over.
Than never to have changed.
.
With blackbirds following me.
I'm digging out my grave.
They close in swallowing me.
The pain it comes in waves.
I'm getting back what I gave.
.
I sweat through the sheet as daylight fades.
As I waste away.
It traps me inside mistakes I've made.
That's the price I pay.
It's harder starting over.
Than never to have changed.
.
With blackbirds following me.
I'm digging out my grave.
They close in swallowing me.
The pain it comes in waves.
I'm getting back what I gave.
.
I drop to the floor like I did before.
Stop watching I'm coughing I can't be more.
What I want and what I need are a constant war.
Like a well full of poison or a rotten core.
The blood goes thin, the fever stings.
And I shake from the hell that the habits bring.
Lay the sick ones down, the bells will ring.
Put pennies on the eyes, let the dead men sing.
.
With blackbirds following me.
I'm digging out my grave.
They close in swallowing me.
The pain it comes in waves.
I'm getting back what I gave.
.
I'm getting back what I gave.
I'm getting back what I gave.
.
.
I'm stuck in this bed you made.
Alone with a sinking feeling.
I saw through the words you said.
To the secrets you've been keeping.
It's written upon your face.
All the lies how they cut so deeply.
You can't get enough you take.
And take and take and never say.
.
No, you've gotta get it inside.
You push it back down.
You push it back down.
No, you'll never get it inside.
Push it back down black out blood in your eye.
.
You say that it's not your fault.
And swear that I am mistaken.
You said it's not what it seems.
No remorse for the trust you're breaking.
You run but then back you fall.
Suffocate in the mess you're making.
You can't get enough you take.
And take and take and take and take.
Fuck it are you listening?.
.
No, you've gotta get it inside.
You push it back down.
You push it back down.
No, you'll never get it inside.
Push it back down.
You push it back down.
No, you've gotta get it inside.
You push it back down.
You push it back down.
No, you'll never get it inside.
Push it back down.
Black out blood in your eye.
.
Floating down, as colors fill the light.
We look up from the ground.
In fields of paper white.
And floating up you pass us in the night.
A future gazing out a past to overwrite.
So come down far below.
We've been waiting to collect the things you know.
Come down far below.
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go.
.
Come down.
Oh.
Come down.
Oh.
Come down.
Oh.
Come down.
Oh.
Come down.
Oh.
.
.
Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time.
Hand grenade pins in every line.
Throw 'em up and let something shine.
Going out of my fucking mind.
.
Filthy mouth, no excuse.
Find a new place to hang this noose.
String me up from atop these roofs.
Knot it tight so I won't get loose.
.
Truth is you can stop and stare.
Bled myself out and no one cares.
Dug a trench out, laid down there.
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere.
.
Yeah, someone pour it in.
Make it a dirt dance floor again.
Say your prayers and stomp it out.
When they bring that chorus in.
.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
Just to throw it away.
Just to throw it away.
.
I bleed it out.
Go, stop the show.
Choppy words in a sloppy flow.
Shotgun opera, lock and load.
.
Cock it back and then watch it go.
Mama, help me, I've been cursed.
Death is rolling in every verse.
Candy paint on his brand new hearse.
.
Can't contain him;.
He knows he works.
Fuck this hurts, I won't lie.
Doesn't matter how hard I try.
Half the words don't mean a thing.
.
And I know that I won't be satisfied.
So, why try ignoring him?.
Make it a dirty dance floor again.
Say your prayers and stomp it out.
When they bring that chorus in.
.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
Just to throw it away.
Just to throw it away.
.
I bleed it out.
I've opened up these scars.
I'll make you face this.
I've pulled myself so far.
I'll make you face this now.
.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
Just to throw it away.
Just to throw it away.
.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
Just to throw it away.
Just to throw it away.
.
I bleed it out.
I bleed it out.
I bleed it out.
.
.
In the dark days I part ways with the blame.
Trying to maintain but it's still all the same.
It's all a game hear my name in the rain.
And the pain I wear on my face with a tear stain.
Your faint fondness honestly it's time to give you a piece of mind.
And show you that you're blind.
And in the design of the world I call mine.
Will you show that you can't stand on both sides of the line.
.
Everything is my fault.
(It's all the same just pass me the blame).
The problems have two faces.
.
Everything is my fault.
(It's all the same just pass me the blame).
The problems have two faces.
.
Pass all the blame over to me.
It will come eventually.
Take the time out to examine all these questions honestly.
.
With my eyes shut I'm seeing the truth in your words.
The ubsurd slurred into beauty to be heard.
You swim through deceit of the lies that you tell.
The stories you sell and knowing you well.
I keep distance and every instance you keep your thoughts concealed.
What I feel is just another spoke in the wheel.
Broke down and trampled by your heel.
And eaten away by my own version of the real.
.
Everything is my fault.
(It's all the same just pass me the blame).
The problems have two faces.
.
Everything is my fault.
(It's all the same just pass me the blame).
The problems have two faces.
.
Pass all the blame over to me.
It will come eventually.
Take the time out to examine all these questions honestly.
.
Nothing thrown down.
(It's all the same just pass me the blame).
Trampled by your heel.
(Play the game and wear the tear stain).
Eaten by my own.
(Pass the pain because you'll feel it if you don't).
Version of the real.
.
Nothing thrown down.
(It's all the same just pass me the blame).
Trampled by your heel.
(Play the game and wear the tear stain).
Eaten by my own.
(Pass the pain because you'll feel it if you don't).
Version of the real.
.
.
Memories consume like opening the wounds.
I'm picking me apart again.
You all assume.
I'm safe here in my room.
Unless I try to start again.
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose.
'cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused.
.
I don't know what's worth fighting for.
Or why I have to scream.
I don't know why I instigate.
And say what I don't mean.
I don't know how I got this way.
I know it's not alright.
So I'm breaking the habit.
I'm breaking the habit tonight.
.
Clutching my cure.
I tightly lock the door.
I try to catch my breath again.
I hurt much more than any time before.
I have no options left again.
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose.
'cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused.
.
I don't know what's worth fighting for.
Or why I have to scream.
I don't know why I instigate.
And say what I don't mean.
I don't know how I got this way.
I'll never be alright.
So I'm breaking the habit.
I'm breaking the habit tonight.
.
I'll paint it on the walls.
'cause I'm the one at fault.
I'll never fight again.
And this is how it ends.
.
I don't know what's worth fighting for.
Or why I have to scream.
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean.
I don't know how I got this way.
I'll never be alright.
So I'm breaking the habit.
I'm breaking the habit.
I'm breaking the habit tonight.
.

[Instrumental].
.
.
A-one, two, three four.
.
Bubbles, bubbles.
I wish my name was bubbles, bubbles.
I wish my friends were bubbles, bubbles.
I drive my car on bubbles, bubbles.
I go real far on bubbles.
On bubbles.
.
Bubbles, bubbles.
I blow a lot of bubbles, bubbles.
I show a lot of bubbles, bubbles.
I ride a plane on bubbles, bubbles.
I go insane on bubbles.
On bubbles.
.
'Cause it's a B and a U.
And a B and a B and an L.
And an E and an S.
.
It's a B and a U.
And a B and a B and an L.
And an E and an S.
And an S.
.
Oh bubbles, oh bubbles.
I wish my name was bubbles, bubbles.
I wish my friends were bubbles, and bubbles.
I drive my car on bubbles, on bubbles.
I go real far on bubbles.
On bubbles, yeah.
.
.
.
.
.
The cycle repeated.
As explosions broke in the sky.
All that I needed.
Was the one thing I couldn't find.
And you were there at the turn.
Waiting to let me know.
.
We're building it up.
To break it back down.
We're building it up.
To burn it down.
We can't wait.
To burn it to the ground.
.
The colors conflicted.
As the flames, climbed into the clouds.
I wanted to fix this.
But couldn't stop from tearing it down.
And you were there at the turn.
Caught in the burning glow.
And I was there at the turn.
Waiting to let you know.
.
We're building it up.
To break it back down.
We're building it up.
To burn it down.
We can't wait.
To burn it to the ground.
.
You told me yes.
You held me high.
And I believed when you told that lie.
I played soldier, you played king.
And struck me down, when I kissed that ring.
You lost that right, to hold that crown.
I built you up, but you let me down.
So when you fall, I'll take my turn.
And fan the flames.
As your blazes burn.
.
And you were there at the turn.
Waiting to let me know.
.
We're building it up.
To break it back down.
We're building it up.
To burn it down.
We can't wait.
To burn it to the ground.
.
When you fall, I'll take my turn.
And fan the flames.
As your blazes burn.
.
We can't wait.
To burn it to the ground.
.
When you fall, I'll take my turn.
And fan the flames.
As your blazes burn.
.
We can't wait.
To burn it to the ground.
.
.
I use the dead wood to make the fire rise.
The blood of innocence burning in the skies.
I filled my cup with the rising of the sea.
And poured it out in an ocean of debris.
.
Ooh, I'm swimming in the smoke.
Of bridges I have burned.
So don't apologize.
I'm losing what I don't deserve.
What I don't deserve.
.
We held our breathe when the clouds began to form.
But you were lost in the beating of the storm.
But in the end we were made to be apart.
In separate chambers of the human heart.
.
Ooh, I'm swimming in the smoke.
Of bridges I have burned.
So don't apologize.
I'm losing what I don't deserve.
It's in the blackened bones.
Of bridges I have burned.
So don't apologize.
I'm losing what I don't deserve.
What I don't deserve.
.
I'm swimming in the smoke.
Of bridges I have burned.
So don't apologize.
I'm losing what I don't deserve.
The blame is mine alone.
For bridges I have burned.
So don't apologize.
I'm losing what I don't deserve.
What I don't deserve.
What I don't deserve, ooh woah.
What I don't deserve.

I use the dead wood to make the fire rise.
The blood of innocence burning in the skies.

What do I do to ignore them behind me?.
Do I follow my instincts blindly?.
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams.
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?.
Do I sit here and try to stand it?.
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?.
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness.
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?.
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin.
I make the right moves but I'm lost within.
I put on my daily facade but then.
I just end up getting hurt again.
By myself (myself).
.
I ask why, but in my mind.
I find I can't rely on myself (myself).

I can't hold on.
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin.
It's all too much to take in.

To end things watching everything spin.
With thoughts of failure sinking in.
.
If I turn my back I'm defenseless.
And to go blindly seems senseless.
If I hide my pride and let it all go on.
Then they'll take from me 'till everything is gone.
If I let them go I'll be outdone.
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun.
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer.
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer.

She can't hide no matter how hard she tries.
Her secret disguise behind her lies.
And at night she cries away her pride.
With eyes shut tight staring at her inside.
All her friends know why she can't sleep at night.
All her family asking if she's all right.
All she wants to do is get rid of this hell.
Well all she's gotta do is stop kidding herself.

She can only fool herself for so long.

When it comes to how to live his life.
He can't be told.
Says he's got it all under control.
Thinks he knows it's not a problem he's stuck with.
But in reality, it'd be a problem to just quit.
An addict and he can't hold the reigns.
The pain is worse cause his friends have it the same.
Tries to slow down the problem he's got.
But can't get off the carousel.
Until he makes it stop.

Warm me up in a nova's glow.

She had never really understood.
She demanded her respect.
Twenty years of falling under foot.
Twenty reason to regret.
You would look for what you couldn't see.
Scared to be what she became.
She would tell you what you couldn't be.
And why you had yourself to blame.
.
Alone again.
It's all becoming clear.
You hold it in.
Pretending not hear.

This voice without a sound.
Voice that tears you down.
You're trying not to fear.
Saying this is in your head.
But whispers in your ear.
Saying this is what you get.

She was ready with your penalty.
When eventually you'd fall.
She was there inside your memory.
Saying this was all your fault.

Caught up against the wall again.
Tied my chain to the ball again.

Sleep sleep sleep.

Cut and bruised by the fall again.
Lick my wounds like a dog again.

Please let it be but don't.

Crawling in my skin.
These wounds, they will not heal.
Fear is how I fall.
Confusing what is real.
.
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface.
Consuming, confusing.
This lack of self control I fear is never ending.
Controlling.
I can't seem.
To find myself again.
My walls are closing in.
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced.
That there's just too much pressure to take).
I've felt this way before.
So insecure.

It's haunting how I can't seem.

Nothing compares to a quiet evening alone.
Just the one, two i was just counting on.
That never happens.
I guess I'm dreaming again.
Let's be more than this.
.
I am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard.
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact that everyone can see.
these scars.
I am what I want you to want what I want you to feel.
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you, to just believe.
this is real.
So I let go, watching you, turn your back like you always do.
Face away and pretend that I'm not.
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got.
.
I can't feel the way I did before.
Don't turn your back on me.
I won't be ignored.
Time won't heal this damage anymore.
Don't turn your back on me.
I won't be ignored.
.
If you want to play it like a game.
Well, come on, come on, let's play.
Cause I'd rather waste my life pretending.
Than have to forget you for one whole minute.

They taped over your mouth.
Scribbled out the truth with their lies.
You little spies.

Folks, we have a very special guest for you tonight.
I would like to introduce.
.
Mr. Hahn.
.
Let's hear it for the great.
Mr. Hahn.

And now for a lesson in rhythm management.
Let's begin.
.
Alright now.
Wasn't that fun?.
Let's try something else.
.

Baby, I said baby.
I'm gonna leave you baby.
I'm gonna leave you baby.
I'm gonna tie you up to the railroad tracks.

Gonna tie you up to the railroad tracks.
I'm gonna tie you up.
Leave you down there by the railroad tracks.
When the train comes by, it's gonna take you away.
Ooh yeah.
.
.
Listen,.
My blood feels like it's sitting still in my viens.
My motivation was gone before it even came.
Today and yesterday, they both seem the same.
And no matter how I try I just can't change.
Give me one reason I should go outside.
Everything'll be the same no matter what I try.
Some people'll live and some people'll die.
Some people'll build their whole life on a lie.
I used to blame you for the things that I thought you'd say.
So now I can't blame you for going away.
Cause these memories are the blood beating under my skin.
Repeating the same thoughts again and again Again and again.
(You said we couldn't last long enough or be strong enough).
Again and again.
(You said our voices weren't loud enough but we've had enough because).
We want our future back,.
We want our own mistakes, to take our own path.
We wanna do it again Again and again.
(You said we couldn't last long enough or be strong enough).
Again and again.
(You said our voices weren't loud enough but we've had enough because).
We want our future back, We want our own mistakes, to take our own path.

I have a dream of a scene between the green hills.
Clouds pull away and the sunlight's revealed.
People don't talk about keeping it real.
It's understood that they actually will.
And intoxicated and stimulated emcees.
Staring into dreams, paranoid, are gone in the breeze.
Watch them flee, hip-hop heads.
Take a walk with me and what you'll see.
Is a land where the sand's made of crushed up wax.
And the sky beyond you is Krylon Blue.
And everybody speaks in a dialective rhyme.
Emcees have left materialism behind them.
Meanwhile I just grip my mic.
And hope me and my team make it through all right.
Because say what you will and say what you might.
But don't ignore who it's for at the end of the night.
.
Because this is dedicated to the kids.
Dedicated to wherever music lives.
Dedicated to those tired of the same old same.
And dedicated to the people advancing the game.
What's real.
Is the kids who know that something's wrong.
What's real.
Is the kids who think they don't belong.
What's real.
Is the kids who have nowhere to run.
Who're hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun.
.
I've seen a lot of shit.
I've talked to a bum out on Sunset Strip.
He asked me, 'How would you feel.
If everybody acted like you didn't exist.
You'd lose your grip, and probably eventually flip'.
So let it be know the only reason that we do this.
Is so you can pick it up and just bang your head to it.
While emcees fight to see who can be the commonist.
We float overhead like a space oddysey monolith.
Overseeing the game over being part of the same old thing.
It's all going to change and a hurricane of darkness and pain.
And acidic rain, promises you won't do it again.
Meanwhile I just grip my mic.
And hope me and my team make it through all right.
Because say what you will and say what you might.
But don't ignore who it's for at the end of the night.
.

Pulling me close the shadow is warm inside.
This is where I feel at home, this is my place to hide.

This is dedicated to the kids.
Dedicated to wherever music lives.
Dedicated to those tired of the same old same.
And dedicated to the people advancing the game.
What's real.
Is the kids who know that something's wrong.
What's real.
Is the kids who think they don't belong.
What's real.
Is the kids who have nowhere to run.
Who're hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun.

This is dedicated to the kids.

Everybody who doesn't feel safe.
What's real.
Everybody who knows they're out of place.
What's real.
Everybody with nowhere to run.
Who're hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun.

I ordered a frappuccino.
Where's my fucking frappuccino.
All right let's do this.
.
When I pretend, everything is what I want it to be.
I looked exactly like what you always wanted to see.
When I pretend, I can't forget about the criminal I am.
Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can, but.
I can't pretend that this is they way it'll stay, I'm just (trying to bend the truth).
I can't pretend of who you want me to be so I'm (lying my way from).
.
If you feelin' like a pimp nigga, go and brush your shoulders off.
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off.
Niggas is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you.
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder.
.
I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force.
Tryin' to hustle some things, that go with the Porsche.
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced.
Middle finger to the law, nigga grippin' my balls.
Said the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'.
All the ballers is bouncin they like the way I be leanin.
All the rappers be hatin, off the track that I'm makin'.
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it.
Came from the bottom the bottom, to the top of the pops.
Nigga London, Japan and I'm straight off the block.
Like a running back, get it man, I'm straight off the block.
I can run it back, nigga 'cause I'm straight with the Roc.
.
If you feelin' like a pimp nigga, go and brush your shoulders off.
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off.
Niggas is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you.
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder.

You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder.
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder.
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder.
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder.

Your homey Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda.
I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover.
Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yes sir.
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya.
But like, fifty-two cards when I'm, I'm through dealin.
Now fifty-two bars come out, now you feel 'em.
Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling.
In case fifty-two broads come out, now you chillin.
With a boss bitch of course S.C. On the sleeve.
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen.
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean.
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real, chill.
.
Yeah, I remember what they taught to me.
Remember condescending took for who I ought to be.
Remember listenin' to all of that and this again.
So I pretended up a person who was fitting in.
And now you think this person really is me and I'm (trying to bend the truth).
But the more I push the more I'm pulling away 'cause I'm (lying my way from).
.
You (Nah, no turning back now).
I wanna be pushed aside so let me go.
(Nah, no turning back now).
Let me take me back my life.
I'd rather be all alone (No turning back now).
And anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see (Nah, no turning back now).
The very worst part of you.
The very worst part of you, it's me!.
.
This isn't what I wanted to be.
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me, like this.
This isn't what I wanted to be.
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me, like this.
This isn't what I wanted to be.
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me, like this.
This isn't what I wanted to be.
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me, like this.

You (Nah, no turning back now).
I wanna be pushed aside so let me go.
(Nah, no turning back now).
Let me take me back my life.
I'd rather be all alone (No turning back now).

The very worst part of you, it's me!.

Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe.
Sometimes I need you to stay away from me.
Sometimes I'm in disbelief, I didn't know.
Somehow I need you to go.
.
Don't stay.
Forget our memories.
Forget our possibilities.
What you were changing me into.
(Just give me myself back and).
Don't stay.
Forget our memories.
Forget our possibilities.
Take all your faithlessness with you.
(Just give me myself back and).
Don't stay.
.
Sometimes I feel like I trusted you too well.
Sometimes I just feel like screaming at myself.
Sometimes I'm in disbelief, I didn't know.
Somehow I need to be alone.
.
Don't stay.
Forget our memories.
Forget our possibilities.
What you were changing me into.
(Just give me myself back and).
Don't stay.
Forget our memories.
Forget our possibilities.
Take all your faithlessness with you.
(Just give me myself back and).
Don't stay.
.
I don't need you anymore, don't want to be ignored.
I don't need one more day, of you wasting me away.
I don't need you anymore, I don't want to be ignored.
I don't need one more day, of you wasting me away.
(With no apologies).
.
Don't stay.
Forget our memories.
Forget our possibilities.
What you were changing me into.
(Just give me myself back and).
Don't stay.
Forget our memories.
Forget our possibilities.
Take all your faithlessness with you.
(Just give me myself back control).
Don't stay.
Don't stay.
Don't stay.

Torture me,make me feel like I am reel.
Torture me,drag me under you.
Time lifts me up and down.
Time makes me sharp.

The little things give you away.
The little things give you away.
The little things give you away.
.
You don't believe in me do you.
I mean nothing to you.
The little things give you away.
.
Don't even care what your breaking.
And I'm not mistaking.
The little things give you away.
.
The little things give you away.
The little things give you away.
.
You don't believe in me do you.
I mean nothing to you.
The little things give you away.

Don't even care what your breaking.
And I'm not mistaking.
The little things give you away.

The little things give you away.
The little things give you away.

I close my eyes, only for a moment, and the moment's gone.
All my dreams, pass before my eyes, a curiosity.
Dust in the wind, all they are is dust in the wind..
Same old song, just a drop of water in an endless sea.
All we do, crumbles to the ground, though we refuse to see.
.
Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind.
.
[Now] Don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky.
It slips away, and all your money won't another minute buy..
.
Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind.
Dust in the wind, everything is dust in the wind..

It's easier to run.
Replacing this pain with something numb.
It's so much easier to go.
Than face all this pain here all alone.
.
Something has been taken from deep inside of me.
A secret I've kept locked away.
No one can ever see.
Wounds so deep they never show.
They never go away.
Like moving pictures in my head.
For years and years they've played.
.
If I could change I would take back the pain I would.
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would.
If I could stand up and take the blame I would.
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would.
If I could change I would take back the pain I would.
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would.
If I could stand up and take the blame I would.
I would take all the shame to the grave.
.
It's easier to run.
Replacing this pain with something numb.
It's so much easier to go.
Than face all this pain here all alone.
.
Sometimes I remember the darkness of my past.
Bringing back these memories I wish I didn't have.
Sometimes I think of letting go and never looking back.
And never moving forward so there'd never be a past.
.
If I could change I would take back the pain I would.
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would.
If I could stand up and take the blame I would.
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would.
If I could change I would take back the pain I would.
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would.
If I could stand up and take the blame I would.
I would take all the shame to the grave.
.
Just washing it aside.
All of the helplessness inside.
Pretending I don't feel misplaced.
Is so much simpler than change.
.
It's easier to run.
Replacing this pain with something numb.
It's so much easier to go.
Than face all this pain here all alone.
.
It's easier to run.
If I could change I would take back the pain I would.
Retrace every wrong move that I made.
It's easier to go.
If I could change I would take back the pain I would.
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would.
If I could stand up and take the blame I would.
I would take all the shame to the grave.

Hey yo when this first started off it was just Linkin Park.
Then in the middle came Motion Man.
And at the end of it all it was Kutmasta Kut wit a remix.
.
One thing I don't know why.
It doesn't even matter how hard you try.
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time.
All I know, time was just slipping way.
.
And I watched it count down till the end of the day.
Watched it watch me and the words that I say.
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins.
I know that I didn't look out below.
.
And I watched the time go right out the window.
Trying to grab hold, trying not to watch.
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock.
But in the end no matter what I pretend.
.
The journey is more important than the end or the start.
And what it meant to me will eventually be.
A memory of the time when I tried so hard.
.
I tried so hard.
And got so far.
But in the end.
It doesn't even matter.
.
I had to fall.
To lose it all.
But in the end.
It doesn't even matter.
.
Yo one thing, one thing I don't know why.
It doesn't even matter how hard you try.
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain the due time.
All I know, time to so-socialize like the host of the party.
.
All for shake and made eye contact.
Party control showing all that.
Northeast, Southwest coast.
Stand out the window, no opportunity to mingle.
.
I tried to show her, if you could just sense a middle disorder.
I brought you back of the thing.
Like the imaginary man of your dreams.
Well, you would always seem to make it worth it.
.
A pig skin I never nerved you.
You felt lever never pleather, real bringing the pleasure.
By any means and means of leaving you teens.
Holler for teen magazines but I tried so hard.
.
I tried so hard.
And got so far.
But in the end.
It doesn't even matter.
.
I had to fall.
To lose it all.
But in the end.
It doesn't even matter.
.
Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Mo Motion Man.
Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kutmasta Kut Kutmasta Kurt.
Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Motion Man.
Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kurt.
.
One thing I don't know how.
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now.
Because when I designed this rhyme I was scared of it all.
Scared to fall, I hadn't even tried to crawl.
.
And I was forced to run, with you mocking me.
Stopping me, back stabbing me constantly.
Remembering all those times you fought with me.
Watch the clock now chop full of hypocrisy.
.
And now your mouth wishes it could inhale.
Every single little thing you said and make it expel.
Every single word you sputter just to get your piece, but it really doesn't matter to me.
Because from the start to the end no matter what I pretend.
.
The journey is more important than the end or the start.
And what it meant to me will eventually be.
A memory of the time when I tried so hard.
.
I tried so hard.
And got so far.
But in the end.
It doesn't even matter.
I had to fall.
.
To lose it all.
But in the end.
It doesn't even matter.
In the end.
.

VERSE 1:.
Writing with a head full of buckets of red,.
And what I said still stuck in my head,.
But still misled thinking the things I do,.
Would make you never wanna come back,.
When in our thumbtacks, you could never run from that..
Being trapped in this with you,.
Something that I never wanted to do..
But through it all, you got to see,.
The world I want to be,.
Is over the pen again, letting it outta me,.
In the center of the day and the dream,.
Seein all my thoughts getting' lost in between..
Realize it was not the way that it seems,.
And the killing and the killer with a head full of screams..
.
CHORUS.
I wanna live in another place,.
Where no one can say that I live for them..
(Jealousy is not meant to be for me).
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy,.
A place for my head..
.
VERSE 2:.
We're gonna be crushed when it all falls apart,.
Knowing that I'm hollow, hoping that you won't know,.
The strain it puts to me, seeing what you've done and consequently,.
I've run away, just hidden again, within the boundaries.
Of the nameless, don't want me to say this,.
But you're draggin' me down, lost in the chaos, bein' tossed around..
.
PRE-CHORUS.
Singin' again to myself, a head full of hectic,.
Hope that some day you'll regret this..
Everything's the wrong place the wrong time,.
addict to the panic of my confine..
.
CHORUS: (Repeat).
.
BRIDGE:.
You, try to take the best of me, go away..
You, try to take the best of me, go away..

Riding with a head full of bodies are red.
And what I said still stuck in my head.
But misled thinking the things I do would make you never wanna come back.
When I run from that to a place I can't find you at.
Being trapped in this with you, somethin that I never wanted to do.
And through it all you've got to see that where I want to be.
Is over the pen again letting it out of me.
In the center of the day in the dream, you and then my thoughts.
getting lost in between, realizing one not the way that is seems.
And the killin and the killin with the head full of screams.
.
I wanna live in another place.
Where no one can say that I live for them.
(So you see its not ment to be for me).
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy.
A place for my head.
.
In a second it starts.
We'll both be crushed when it all falls apart.
Knowing that I'm hollow, hoping that you won't know.
The strain it puts to me, seeing what you've done.
And consequently I've run away and just hitting again.
Within the boundaries of an anguish.
Don't want me to say this, but you're dragging me down.
Getting lost in the chaos being tossed around.
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic.
Hope that some day you'll regret this.
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time.
To be added to the panic of the confine.
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic.
Hope that some day you'll regret this.
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time.
To be added to the panic in the confine.

I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy.
A place for my head.

I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard.
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact.
That everyone can see these scars.
I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel.
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you.
To just believe this is real.
So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do.
Face away and pretend I'm not.
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got.
.
I can't feel the way I did before.
Don't turn your back on me.
I won't be ignored.
Time won't heal this damage anymore.
Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored.
.
I am, a little bit insecure, a little unconfident.
'Cause you don't understand I do what I can.
But sometimes I don't make sense.
I am, what you never want to say, but I've never had a doubt.
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me out.
So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do.
You face away and pretend I'm not.
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got.
.
I can't feel the way I did before.
Don't turn your back on me.
I won't be ignored.
Time won't heal this damage anymore.
Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored.
.
You hear me out now.
You're gonna listen to me like it or not.
Right now, hear me out now.
You're gonna listen to me like it or not.
Right now.
.
I can't feel the way I did before.
Don't turn your back on me.
I won't be ignored.
Time won't heal this damage anymore.
Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored.
.
I can't feel.
Don't turn your back on me.
I won't be ignored.
Time won't heal.
Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored.

I'm swimming in the smoke.
Of bridges I have burned.
So don't apologize.
I'm losing what I don't deserve.
.
The blame is mine alone.
For bridges I have burned.

So don't apologize.
I'm losing what I don't deserve.
What I don't deserve.

I looked in the ocean.
Looked in the sea.
Found her laughing.
Watching for me.
Left the door open.
Left the door wide.
Kept it inside.
.
Don't trust.
If you don't than your fighting for what.
.
Fighting for a place we can call home.
Looking for a way not to be alone.
Fighting for a place we can call home.
Looking for a way not to be alone.
Not to be alone.
.
Fighting for a place we can call home.
Looking for a way not to be alone.
Fighting for a place we can call home.
Looking for a way not to be alone.
Not to be alone.

Nothing ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them.
Sometimes I wonder why this is happenin'.
It's like nothing I can do would distract me when.
I think of how I shot myself in the back again.
'Cause from the infinite words I can say I.
Put all pain you gave to me on display.
But didn't realize instead of setting it free I.
Took what I hated and made it a part of me.

Tearing me apart with the words you wouldn't say.
And suddenly tomorrow's a moment washed away.
'Cause I don't have a reason and you don't have the time.
But we both keep on waiting for something we won't find.
.
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday.
With shadows floating over, the scars begin to fade.
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away.
Standing at the end of the final masquerade.
The final masquerade.
.
All I ever wanted the secrets that you keep.
All you ever wanted the truth I couldn't speak.
'Cause I can't see forgiveness and you can't see the crime.
And we both keep on waiting for what we left behind.

With shadows floating over, the scars begin to fade.
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away.

From the top to the bottom.
Bottom to top I stop.
At the core I've forgotten.
In the middle of my thoughts.
Taken far from my safety.
The picture is there.
The memory won't escape me.
But why should I care.
From the top to the bottom.
Bottom to top I stop.
At the core I've forgotten.
In the middle of my thoughts.
Taken far from my safety.
The picture is there.
The memory won't escape me.
But why should I care.
.
There's a place so dark you can't see the end.
(Skies cock back) and shock that which can't defend.
The rain then sends dripping acidic questions.
Forcefully, the power of suggestion.
Then with the eyes shut looking thought the rust and rotten dust.
A spot of light floods the floor.
And pours over the rusted world of pretend.
And the eyes ease open and its dark again.
.
From the top to the bottom.

.
In the memory you'll find me.
Eyes burning up.
The darkness holding me tightly.
Until the sun rises up.
.
Moving all around.
Screaming of the ups and downs.
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound.
The wheels go 'round and the sunset creeps past the.
Street lamps, chain-link, and concrete.
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn.
Floats on down the street 'til the wind is gone.
The memory now is like the picture was then.
When the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again.

DJ Vice:.
i'm serious!.
it can't get no bigger than this..
my homie Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park puttin down with the DJ Vice.
let em know Mike!.
.
Mike Shinoda:.
Let it begin with the stutter of light and short circuits.
driven to give a minimal life more purposse.
behind closed curtains i don't even exist.
magic's created in he mirrors in the mist.
it's mike shinoda and dj vice at the same time.
rhymes like rain that trickle down your main line.
and flood your street over a high tech beat.
to sneak two and a full beats into turntable techniques.
I dont sleep to dream.
i sleep to build stamina.
energy to plant in advanced, get ya camera.
with these rhymes you better seal off the parameter.
one line and ya swimmin off the south coast of canada.
this is the sound, me and vice in the cut.
roughin it up just in case you might get tough.
nitrogen n in my breath just to light things up.
and dna in every line so it's live enough.
dj vice.

The memory won't escape me.
But why should I care.
.
We're stuck in a place so dark, you could hardly see.
A manner of matter that splits with the words I breathe.
And as the rain drips acidic questions around me.
I block out the sight of the powers that be.
Duck away into the darkness, times up.
I wind up in a rusted world with eyes shut.
So tight that it blurs into the world of pretend.
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again.

Listen to the sound, dizzy from the ups and downs.
And nauseated by the polluted rock that's all around.
Watchin' the wheels of cars that pass.
I look past to the last of the light and the long shadows it casts.
A window grows and captures the eye.
And cries out yellow light as it passes me by.
And a young, shadowy figure sits in front of a box.
Inside a building of rocks with antennas on top.
Now, nothing can stop in this land of the pain.
The same lose, not knowing they were part of the game.
And while the insides change, the box stays the same.
And the figure inside could bear anybody's name.
The memories I keep are from a time like then.
I put on my paper so I could come back to them.
Someday I'm hopin' to close my eyes and pretend.
That this crumpled up paper can be perfect again.
.
From the top to the bottom.
Bottom to top I stop.
At the core I've forgotten.
In the middle of my thoughts.

I'm here at the podium talking, the ceremonial offerings.
Dedicated to urban dysfunctional offspring.
What's happening.
City governments are eternally napping.
Trapped in greedy covenants, causin' urban collapsing.
Bullets that scar souls, with dark holds, get more than your car stole.
Some hearts be blacker than charcoal.
For real, this society's deprivation depends not on our differences, but the separation within.
No preparation is made, limited aid, minimum wage.
Livin' in a tenement cage where rent isn't paid.
Tragedy within a parade.
The darkness overspread like permanent plague.
I'm the forgotten.
.
In the memory you'll find me.
Eyes burning up.
The darkness holding me tightly.
Until the sun rises up.

I don't know who to trust your surprise.
(Everyone feels so far away from me).
Happy thoughts sift through dust and the lies.
(Trying not to break but I'm so tired of this deceit).
.
(Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet.
(All I ever think about is this).
(All the tiring time between).
(And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me).
.
Take everything from the inside and throw it all away.
'cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you.
.
Tension is building inside steadily.
(Everyone feels so far away from me).
Happy thoughts forcing their way out of me.
(Trying not to break but I'm so tired of this deceit).
(Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet).
(All I ever think about is this).
(All the tiring time between).
(And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me).
.
Take everything from the inside and throw it all away.
'Cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you.
.
I won't waste myself on you.
You.
You.
Waste myself on you.
You.

I'll take everything from the inside and throw it all away.

Of course you know what a fuse is....
It's a long piece of cord impregnated with gun powder.
When you strike a match and light it.
It burns, fitfully, spiraling to it's end.
At which there is, a little surprise.
.
Krypton, short suit MCs you'll be ripped on.
You fell off and it's my lyric sheet just slipped on.
Get gone, spit on mic's made in Hong Kong.
Rock on, sing songs mightier than King King.
A Donkey, you think you want me or want this.
Want some, hold your reputation for Ransom.
With these here, handsomely crafted tactics.
To break a snake and see like a cheap prophylactic.
Galactic, space now yeah that grabs attention.
Crackheads nodded like a pest can't even mention.
Right a pat traps gas tracks in sections.
Kid steps this he need witness protection.
.
Trying to see while I.
If you see it.
I'll be here (2x).
.
It was the junkyard crooked letter C-I-entific.
Duck us, the ruckus I'll bring stings your eardrum.
Hear one, lalala loose friend me fearsome.
Opposing troops on my home front shall be gone.
Testing the eight-hundred, eighteenth battalion.
Shallow the one who's run like rebels.
Enola gay rhymes kicked the notch up a level.
In intensity, send back the tax that you sent to me.
Blow up your spot with grenades that were meant for me.
MP3 versus R33 MCs, Swiss change your gear putting shrapnel in the breeze.
We're MCs with enemy companies with my hand full of lyrics talking 'bout you want these.
Please, don't even speak the name of channels and low gadget mic shit put it down like pens.
For my friends and my fame let them dodge it around this mic shot through the back of an MCs hand.
With the strength that he had a bridge you don't want that close body fields in hand to hand combat.
Battle cats, it's like the sectional speech warfare words slash cords.
Come deford shots get rid don't question my intention when your butt gets kicked.
.
Trying to see while I.
If you see it.
I'll be here.
Tech broke italic syllabalic attacks.
Trying to see while I.
If you see it.
I'll be here.
You want these MCs lyrically back smacks.
.
Why wait, I didn't look down myself (8x).
Trying to see while I.

I Dreamed I was missing.
You were so scared.
But no one would listen.
Cause no one else cared.
.
After my dreaming.
I woke with this fear.
What am I leaving?.
When I'm done here.
.
So if you're asking me.
I want you to know.
.
When my time comes,  (Chorus).
Forget the wrong that I've done.
Help me leave behind,.
Some reasons to be missed.
.
Don't resent me, and (Chorus2).
When you're feeling empty.
Keep me in your memory.
And leave out all the rest,.
Leave out all the rest.
.
Don't be afraid.
I've taken my beating.
I've shared what I made.
.
I'm strong on the surface.
Not all the way through.
I've never been perfect.
But neither have you.
.
So if you're asking me now.
I want you to know.
.
When my time comes.
Forget the wrong that I've done.
Help me leave behind,.
Some reasons to be missed.
.
Don't resent me, and.
When you're feeling empty.
Keep me in your memory.
And leave out all the rest,.
Leave out all the rest.
.
Forgetting all the hurt inside.
You learned to hide so well.
Pretending someone else.
Can come and save me from myself.
.
I can't be who you are.
.
When my time comes.
Forget the wrong that I've done.
Help me leave behind,.
Some reasons to be missed.
.
Don't resent me, and.
When you're feelilng empty.
Keep me in your memory.
And leave out all the rest,.
Leave out all the rest.
.
Forgetting all the hurt inside.
You've learned to hide so well.
Pretending someone else.
Can come and save me from myself.
.
I can't be who you are.
I can't be who you are.
.
.
.
Wake in a sweat again.
Another day's been laid to waste.
In my disgrace.
Stuck in my head again.
Feels like I'll never leave this place.
There's no escape.
I'm my own worst enemy.
.
[Chorus].
I've given up.
I'm sick of living.
Is there nothing you can say?.
Take this all away.
I'm suffocating!.
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me!.
.
I don't know what to take.
Thought I was focused, but I'm scared.
I'm not prepared.
I hyperventilate.
Looking for help somehow, somewhere.
And no one cares.
I'm my own worst enemy.
.
[Chorus].
.
God!.
.
Put me out of my misery.
Put me out of my misery.
Put me out of my....
Put me out of my fucking misery!.
.
[Chorus].
.
.
Will you, walk me.
To the edge again.
Shaking, lonely, and I am drinking again.
Woke up tonight and no one's here with me.
I'm giving in to you.
.
Take me under.
I'm giving in to you.
I'm dying tonight.
I'm giving in to you.
Watch me crumble.
I'm giving in to you.
I'm crying tonight.
I'm giving in to you.
.
Caught up, in life.
Losing all my friends.
Family has tried, to heal all my addictions.
Tragic it seems, to be alone again.
I'm giving in ... to you.
.
Take me under.
I'm giving in to you.
I'm dying tonight.
I'm giving in to you.
Watch me crumble.
I'm giving in to you.
I'm crying tonight.
I'm giving in to you.
.
.
I look forward, to dying tonight.
Drink till i'm myself, life's harder every day.
The stress has got me.
I'm giving in.
Giving in.
Giving in now!.
.
Take me under.
(I'm killing all the pain).
I'm dying tonight.
(I'm sick of all this faith).
Watch me crumble.
(I'm killing all the pain).
I'm crying tonight.
.
I'm giving in to you.
Take me under.
I'm giving in to you.
I'm dying tonight.
I'm giving in to you.
Take me under.
I'm giving in to you.
I'm dying tonight.
I'm giving in to you.

Tell us all again.
What you think we should be.
What the answers are.
What it is we can't see.
Tell us all again.
How to do what you say.
How to fall in line.
How there's no other way.
But oh, we all know.
.
You're guilty all the same.
Too sick to be ashamed.
You want to point your finger.
But there's no one else to blame.

That our hands are unclean.
That we're unprepared.
That you have what we need.
Show us all again.
'Cause we cannot be saved.
Cause the end is near.
Now there's no other way.
And oh, you will know.

Yeah, you already know what it is.
Can y'all explain, what kind of land is this.
When a man has plans of being rich.
If he falls off his plans, he's wealthy?.
Dirty money scheme, a clean split.
Nonsense the same,.
Even corporate hands are filthy.
Talk team, they take the paper route.
All they think about is bank accounts, assets and realty.
Anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience.
No regrets and guilt free, you claim that ain't the way that he built me.
Smoke screen, before the flames.
Know as soon as they're done what the deal be.
Say it's time for things to change.
We arrange that dope product we built cheap.
Anything if it's more to gain.
Dream, manipulated like artists, it's real deep.
Until no more remains, but I'm still me.
Like authentic hip-hop and rock, to pop and radio.
You record companies kill me.
Try to force me to strain it, no way.
They got the gall to say "yo, how real can real be?".
You feel me? you will see, the greed will be to blame.
Greedy for the fame, TV or a name.
Media, the game, to me your all the same.
You're guilty.
.
You're guilty all the same.
Too sick to be ashamed.
You want to point your finger.
But there's no one else to blame.
.
You're guilty all the same.

Hybrid.
I've been diggin in crates ever since I was livin in space.
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits.
I mastered numerology, big band theology, performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology.
Invented the mic to so I can start blessin it.
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist.
Many men have tried to shake us.
But I twist mic chords like double helixes to show them what I'm made of.
I buckle knees like leg braces,.
Cast a spell of instrumentalist on all of you MC's who hate us.
So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on.
From now to infinity, let icons be bygones.
I fire bombs, ghostly notes haunt this.
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise.
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice.
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this.

Akira, I've put a kink in the backbones, of clones, with microphones.
Never satisfied my rhyme jones.
Spraying bright day over what you might say.
My blood types krylon, Technicolor type A.
On highways ripe with road rage.
Cages a win, cages a tin, that bounce all around.
Surround sound.
Devouring the scenes.
Subliminal gangrene paintings, over all the same things.
Sing songs karaoke copy bullshit.
Break bones verbally with sticks and stones tactics.
Fourth dimension, compact convention.
Write rhymes with ease while the track stands at attention.
Meant to put you away, with the pencil.
Pistol, official, sixteen line, a rhyme missile.
While you risk your all.
I pick out at your flaws.
Spittin' rah blah, blah, blah you can say you saw.

When I spy my third eye, it's extremely high voltage.

That's why I need ruby quartz glasses,.
'Cause when I glance there's a chance.
That I might blast the masses.
Subliminals transmitted through piano.
Integrated in flow, calculated to nano.

I hear when I bleed as I proceed through time.
I walk through walls and the inanimate obstacles.
By inducing the reduction of cells and molecules.

I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight.
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right.
Used to get high with the dead end kids.
Abandoned houses where the shadows live.
I never been higher than I was that night.
I woke up driving my car.
I couldn't see then what I see right now.
The road dissolving like an empty vow.
Couldn't remember where I'd been that night.
I knew I took it too far.
.
All you said to do was slow down.
I remember, now I remember.
All you said to do was slow down.
But I was already gone.
.
I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight.
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right.
I know what I want, but it feels like I'm paralyzed.
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right (halfway right).
.
Told me "Kid, you're going way to fast.
You burn too bright, you know you'll never last".
It was bullshit then, I guess it makes sense now.
I woke up driving my car.
Said I'd lose you if I lost control.
I just laughed because what do they know?.
Here I am, standing all alone.
Because I took it too far.
.
All you said to do was slow down.
I remember, now I remember.
All you said to do was slow down.
But I was already gone.

I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight.
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right.
I know what I want, but it feels like I'm paralyzed.
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right , halfway right.

Turn my mic up louder.
I got to say something.
Lightweights stepping aside,.
When we come in.
Feel it in your chest.
The syllables get pumping.
People on the street.
They panic and start running.
Words on loose leaf.
Sheet complete coming.
I jump on my mind.
I summon the rhyme I'm dumping.
Healing the blind.
I promise to let the sun in.
Sick of the dark ways.
We march to the drumming.
Jump when they tell us.
They want to see jumping.
Fuck that, I want to.
See some fist pumping.
Risk something.
Take back what's yours.
Say something that you know.
They might attack you for.
'Cause I'm sick of being treated.
Like I had before.
Like it's stupid standing for.
What I'm standing for.
Like this war is really just.
A different brand of war.
Like it doesn't cater the rich.
And an abandon the poor.
Like they understand you.
In the back of the jet.
When you can't put gas in your tank.
These fuckers are laughing their way.
To the bank and cashing their check.
Asking you to have compassion and to have some respect.
.
For a leader so nervous.
In an obvious way.
Stuttering and mumbling.
For nightly news to replay.
And the rest of the world.
Watching at the end of the day.
In the living room laughing.
Like what did he say?.
.
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen.
.
In my living room watching.
But I am not laughing.
'Cause when it gets tense.
I know what might happen.
The world is cold.
The bold men take action.
Have to react.
Or get blown into fractions.
Ten years old is something to see.
Another kid my age drugged under a jeep.
Taken and bound and found later under a tree.
I wonder if he thought the "next one could be me".
Do you see?.
The soldiers they're out today.
That brush the dust from bulletproof vests away.
It's ironic.
At times like this you pray.
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday.
There's bombs in the buses, bikes, roads.
Inside your markets, your shops, your clothes.
My dad, he's got a lot of fear I know.
But enough pride inside not to let that show.
My brother had a book he would hold with pride.
A little red cover with a broken spine.
In the back he hand wrote a quote inside.
When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die.
.
Meanwhile, the leader just talks away.
Stuttering and mumbling.
For nightly news to replay.
And the rest of the world.
Watching at the end of the day.
Both scared and angry.
Like what did he say?.
.
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen.
.
With hands held high.
Into a sky so blue.
As the ocean opens up.
To swallow you.
.
With hands held high.
Into a sky so blue.
The ocean opens up.
To swallow you..

I can't seem to focus,.
It's hopeless unless the sky opens,.
Look you in the eyes and all I see is a blur hopin',.
That my previous mindstate; could be resurrected,.
To the old me; it's like you had me injected with imperfection,.
How could you be so reckless? I initially meant it,.
Seems like you put your effort into me, what am I left with?.
Nothin' but a canvas with a black and white portrait,.
Of me and you, in a burnin' garden of scorchin' orchards..
Simple beauty that's bein torn down by your power,.
That constantly pounds on my soul hour after hour,.
Now I can hardly breathe, get rid of these memories,.
Continually haunting me,.
Cant change who I've come to be,.
The darkness only ends as soon as you open your eyes,.
And you hope to realize that hope is cloaked in disguise,.
Again I look you in the eyes and all I see is a blur,.
But when I look in the mirror I can see who you were..
.
Nothing I can say or do,.
Will take away what I've been through,.
What you were is what I've come to be,.
Nothing you can say to me,.
Will take away these memories,.
What you were is what I've come to be!.
.
(what I've come to be x2).
.
The sky opens wide, to swallow me again,.
Once I am inside, I'm lost and can't pretend,.
These pictures in my mind, are not a part of me,.
These memories hold me tight, till I can hardly breathe.
.
I can hardly breathe (breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe...) x2.
.
I can hardly stop the memories...
.
Nothing I can say or do,.
Will take away what I've been through,.
What you were is what I've come to be,.
Nothing you can say to me,.
Will take away these memories,.
What you were is what I've come to be!.
.
(what I've come to be x2).
.
(Hardly breathe).
(Memories).
(Haunting me).
(Come to be) x2.
.
Now I can hardly breathe, get rid of these memories,.
Continually haunting me,.
Cant change who I've come to be x4.
.
(I can hardly breathe.....).
(I can hardly stop the memories..).
Now I can hardly breathe, change who I've come to be..
.
Nothing I can say or do,.
Will take away what I've been through,.
What you were is what I've come to be,.
Nothing you can say to me,.
Will take away these memories,.
What you were is what I've come to be.
.
.
I don't like my mind right now,.
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary..
Wish that I could slow things down..
I wanna let go but there's comfort in the panic..
And I drive myself crazy,.
Thinking everything's about me..
Yeah I drive myself crazy,.
Cause I can't escape the gravity....
.
I'm holding on. Why is everything so heavy?.
Holding on to much more than I can carry..
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down,.
If I just let go, I'd be set free..
Holding on. Why is everything so heavy?.
.
You say that I'm paranoid,.
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me..
It's not like I make the choice to let my mind stay so fucking messy..
I know I'm not the center of the universe,.
But you keep spinning round me just the same..
I know I'm not the center of the universe,.
But you keep spinning round me just the same..
.
I'm holding on. Why is everything so heavy?.
Holding on to so much more than I can carry..
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down,.
If I just let go, I'd be set free..
Holding on. Why is everything so heavy?.
.
I know I'm not the center of the universe,.
But you keep spinning round me just the same..

I've been taking into crates ever since I was living in space.
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits.
Mastered numerology and big bang theology.
I've been digging in the crates.
Ever since I was living in space.
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits.
I mastered numerology and big bang theology.
Preformed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology.
Invented a mic so I could start blessing it.
Chin checking kids to make my point like an impressionist.
Many men have tried to shake us.
But I twist my cords like double helix's.
To show u what I'm made of.
I buckle knees like leg braces.
Cast a spell of instrumentalist on all of these MC's who hate us.
Try on, leave u with out a shoulder to cry on.
From now to infinity, let icons be bygones.
I fire bombs ghostly notes haunt this.
I tried threats but moved on to a promise.
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice.
And run the gauntlet with whoever that what this is.
.
High voltage.
This is the unforgettable sound.
High voltage.
Bringing u up and taking u down.
High voltage.
Coming at u from every side.
High voltage.
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide.
.
I've put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones.
Never satisfied my rhymes Jones.
Spraying bright day over what u mite say.
My blood type is krylon technicolor type a.
On highways ripe with road rage.
On pages of wind, cages of tin that bounce all around.
Surround sound.
Devouring the scenes.
Subliminal gangrene paintings over all the same things.
Sings songs karaoke copy bullshit.
Break bones verbally with stick and stones tactics.
Fourth dimension compact convection.
Write rhymes with ease while the track stands at attention.
Meant to put u away with.
A pencil, pistol, official, sixteen lines, a rhymes missile.
While you risk your all, I pick at all your flaws.

There are just too many times that people have tried to look inside of me.
Wondering what I think of you well I protect you out of courtesy.
Too many times that I've held on when I needed to push away.
Afraid to say what was on my mind.
Afraid to say what I need to say.
Too many things that you've said about me when I'm not around.
You think having the upper hand means you gotta keep putting me down.
But I've had too many standoffs with you it's about as much as I could stand.
So I wait till the upper hand is mine.
.
One minute you're on top.
The next you're not, watch it drop.
Making your heart stop.
Just before you hit the floor.
One minute you're on top.
The next you're not, missed your shot.
Making your heart stop.
You think you've won.
And then it's all gone.
.
So many people like me that put so much trust in all your lies.
So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside.
So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long.
All I know is that all I want is to feel like I'm not stepped on.
There are so many things you say that make me feel you cross the line.
What goes up will surely fall, and I am counting down the time.
'Cause I've had so many standoffs with you it's about as much as I could stand.
So I waiting until the upper hand is mine.
.
One minute you're on top.
The next you're not, watch it drop.
Making your heart stop.
Just before you hit the floor.
One minute you're on top.
The next you're not, missed your shot.
Making your heart stop.
You think you've won.
And then it's all gone.
And then it's all gone.
And then it's all gone.
And then it's all gone.
Now it's all gone.
I know I'll never trust a single thing you say.
You realize you divide us but you lied anyway.
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all.
But what goes up has got to fall.
.
One minute you're on top.
The next you're not, watch it drop.
Making your heart stop.
Just before you hit the floor.
One minute you're on top.
The next you're not, missed your shot.
Making your heart stop.
You think you've won.
And then it's all gone.
And then it's all gone.
And then it's all gone.
And then it's all gone.
Now it's all gone.
.
.
This summers been cold, and the winter hard.
Tryin' to run away from the sound.
And I oughta know when to stop.
Or to start.
.
Release all the hurt in just one sound.
And I hope no one's around.
Call your name out so loud.
Are ya proud?.
.
'Cause you've got a hold on me.
And though I'll take a chance.
I think I'll still be here, alone.
'Cause you've got a hold on me.
And though I lack the sense to know.
I'll still be here, alone.
.
Well I've got a war with your name.
It's the place I like to blame.
For all of the things I like to do.
They're for you.
.
'Cause you've got a hold on me.
And though I'll take a chance.
I think I'll still be here, alone.
'Cause you've got a hold on me.
And though I lack the sense to know.
I'll still be here, alone.
.
I like the sounds.
To make you mine.
Sit on the.
Well take a chance on me.
.
'Cause you've got a hold on me.
And though I'll take a chance.
I think I'll still be here, alone.
'Cause you've got a hold on me.
And though I lack the sense to know.
I'll still be here, alone.
.
Release all the hurt in just one sound.
and I hope no one's around.
To call your name out so loud.
Are ya proud?.
.
.
I would have sailed away.
If I'd known that nothing would change.
staring out my window sill.
In my wasted prison cell.
.
And I know what you want.
And I know what you fear.
As I cradle your loving.
And watch you disappear.
.
(Chorus).
And I feel your heartbeat.
Pounding in my head.
I like to control you.
Cause I can't control myself.
Myself.
.
Rain,.
Come my way.
Mold my head.
Like a ball of clay.
Softly wither into my grave.
Never to see, the sun again.
.
(Chorus).
.
All alone in a crowd by myself.
So sorry,wish I could find a way.
Back into your hole again.
But I've become your enemy.
.
(Chorus).
.
Hole.

You know I'm a dreamer.
But my heart's of gold.
I had to run away and hide.
Cause I couldn't go home.
.
Just when things went right.
Suddenly it all went wrong.
Just take this song and you'll never feel.
Left all alone.
.
Take me to your heart.
Feel me in your bones.
Just one more night.
And I'm comin' off this.
Long.
winding road.
.
I'm on my way.
I'm on my way.
Home sweet home.
Tonight, tonight.
I'm on my way.
I'm on my way.
Home sweet home.
.
You know that I seen.
To many romantic dreams.
Up in lights, fallin' off.
The silver screen.
.
My heart's like an open book.
For the whole world to read.
Somtimes nothing, keeps me together.
At the seams.
.
I'm on my way.
I'm on my way.
Home sweet home.
Tonight, tonight.
I'm on my way.
Just set me free.
Home sweet home (x4).
.
I'm on my way.
I'm on my way.
Home sweet home.
Tonight, tonight.
I'm on my way.
Just set me free.
Home sweet home.

Just take this song and you'll never feel.
Left all alone.

Every day I wake up.
The sun rains down on me.
But this one seems so different.
It's black as day.
instead.
.
Yeah!.
Broken glass.
In time.
I'll pass, from here I swear I'm scared.
Broken.
glass.
And blood red snow, escapes from quicksand never.
lasting.
.
I must have done something wrong again.
Face the walls and hold him in.
It's not how.
life's supposed to be.
I've cried as many years as.
me.
.
Yeah!.
Broken glass.
And blood red snow,.
my finger tips are scrapped.
Broken glass.
In time.
I'll pass, escapes from quicksand never lasting....
.
Yeah!.
Broken glass.
In time I'll pass, from here.
I swear I hate.
Broken glass.
I'm running fast, no.
more bruised I can't look back, I hated.
Yeah,.
yeah....
.
.
ladies and gents sorry to keep ya'll waiting.
this goes out to everybody still hating.
for those that fake / ya'll can keep on fakin'.
i'm cooking a plate for you to stick your whole face in.
tastes good don't it cousin?  just so you know it's nothin'.
i get you buggin' like some codiene in some robutussin.
it's just the way that i approach each time.
i slap the track and turn around and choke each rhyme.
broadcast to the nation like NBC.
with pages of 16s like an MPC.
deliver an ass-whipping via MP3.
giving you people more reality than MTV.
do it PPV / snap necks with the pressure.
make a mess / then carry you out on a stretcher.
you could sue but / ooh the law won't protect ya.
even the court room sketcher could not sketch ya.
you're not following me / i got your number like.
caller i.d. / try it / you can holler at me.
i promise you pain / i will chop your body in threes.
and you'll be sitting there stuttering / p-p-probabably.
follow me / i got styles / you can copy one.
back of your mind / i know you wanna stop me son.
but here's news for you fucker: that can not be done.
you can think that i'm finished i have not begun.
im grinding / putting these kids to bed.
you think you're hard-boiled / fucker you're an easter egg.
you got a pastel shell and a soft inside / squash your pride.
you think i fucking lost my mind / i'm not playing.
i might as well be making a bomb.
i lay you down to foundation when i'm taking you on.
bet the farm on the rhyme for the sake of my mom.
she's like / mike show these pigs what kind of bacon you're on.
it's funny but don't laugh / money with no cash.
the villain of vocab / i'm killing this notepad.
the realest i wrote man / you don't even know half.
i'm banking a full tank / you're running on low gas.
take that / i'm cutting off your fun.
you're nothing but a butter knife stopping a gun.
we can dance but your chances are slim to none.
and you can think that i'm finished i have not begun.
got a razor-blade tongue and i get this done.
no running just dumping on your clique for fun.
machine shop got it locked like the game's a joke.
say something funny get the whole gang provoked.
better buckle down fucker / go get your own.
we been working ten years just to get this known.
the people on the block starting to get numb.
they expect that its fresh when the new shit come.
here it goes let em know they can fix the frown.
railroad rap hot tracks running you down.
and they ask and repeat how i do this now.
like i'm really gonna tell em how i get this sound.
we just do what we do give you that fix.
we come in the back like we run this bitch.
turn the lights down low / and we start the show.
when i give it to ya / give it right back and it goes.
take that / take that / cutting off your fun.
you're nothing but a butter knife stopping a gun.
we can dance but your chances are slim to none.
you can think that i'm finished i have not begun.
follow me / i got styles / you can copy one.
back of your mind / i know you wanna stop me son.
but here's news for you fucker: that can not be done.
you can think that i'm finished i have not begun.

Ain't nothing working, ain't nothing right.
There's a whole in me, that I can't fill, no matter how hard I try.
.
Hey, hey, hey bartender, hit me with a double.
And introduce me to that girl with the bobble.
I'm looking for trouble tonight.
No momma don't trust me tonight.
You be the center baby, I'll be the quarter back.
High get the tail back, watchin all the play back.
Jaw smash, now heating now rambo.
Up in the hands all, biting on the cannibal.
.
I just want your company.
I want you to comfort me, just come with me.
.
Hey bartender, hit me with another.
I'm just about how to kill this brother.
I'm lookin for trouble tonight.
No momma don't trust me tonight.
You be the beauty baby, I'll be the beast.
Who give a fucker, take it to the bedroom.
Take it to the streets, take it like a man.
Mother fucker, yo bitch chose me, mother fucker.
.
I just want your company.
I want you to comfort me, just come with me.
I just want your company.
I want you to comfort me, just come with me.
.
Take me there, take me with you.
I can't be alone tonight.
I can't trust myself tonight.
I can't trust myself tonight.
Ladies don't trust me tonight.
Take me there, take me with you.
I can't be alone tonight.
I can't trust myself tonight.
I can't trust myself tonight.
No you can't trust me tonight.
.
Ain't nothing working, ain't nothing right.
There's a whole in me, that I can't fill, no matter how hard I try.
Ain't nothing sweeter, ain't nothing wrong.
All the pain that I've received keeps me strong,.
it keeps me moving on.
.
I just want your company,.
I want you to comfort me,.
Just come with me (moving on).
I just want your company,.
I want you to comfort me, just come with me.
I just want your company,.
I want you to comfort me, just come with me.
Comfort me, just come with me.
Comfort me, just come with me.

Like shining oil, this night is dripping down.
Stars are slipping down, glistening.
And I'm trying not to think what I'm leaving now.
No deceiving now, it's time you let me know.
Let me know.
.
[Chorus].
When the lights go out and we open our eyes,.
Out there in the silence, I'll be gone, I'll be gone.
Let the sun fade out and another one rise.
Climbing through tomorrow, I'll be gone, I'll be gone.
.
This air between us is getting thinner now.
Into winter now, bittersweet.
And 'cross that horizon this sun is setting down.
You're forgetting now, it's time you let me go, let me go.
.
[Chorus].
.
And tell them I couldn't help myself.
And tell them I was alone.
Oh, tell me I am the only one.
And there's nothing left to stop me.
.
[Chorus].
.
I'll be gone (I'll be gone).
.
.
Let me apologize to begin with.
Let me apologize for what I'm about to say.
But trying to be genuine was harder than it seemed.
And somehow I got caught up in between.
.
Let me apologize to begin with.
Let me apologize for what I'm about to say.
But trying to be someone else was harder than it seemed.
And somehow I got caught up in between.
.
Between my pride and my promise.
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way.
The things I want to say to you get lost before they come.
The only thing that's worse than one is none.
.
Let me apologize to begin with.
Let me apologize for what I'm about to say.
But trying to regain your trust was harder than it seemed.
And somehow I got caught up in between.
.
Between my pride and my promise.
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way.
The things I want to say to you get lost before they come.
The only thing that's worse than one is none.
.
The only thing that's worse than one is none.
.
And I cannot explain to you.
In anything I say, or do, or plan.
Fear is not afraid of you.
Guilt's a language you can understand.
I cannot explain to you in anything I say or do.
I hope the actions speak the words they can.
.
For my pride and my promise.
For my lies and how the truth gets in the way.
The things I want to say to you get lost before they come.
The only thing that's worse than one is....
For my pride and my promise.
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way.
The things I want to say to you get lost before they come.
The only thing that's worse than one is none.
The only thing that's worse than one is none.
The only thing that's worse than one is none.
.
.
Separate.
Sifting through the wreckage.
I can't concentrate.
Searching for a message.
In the fear and pain.
Broken down and waiting.
For the chance to feel alive.
.
Now in my remains.
Are promises that never came.
Set this silence free.
To wash away the worst of me.
.
Come apart.
Falling in the cracks of every broken heart.
Digging through the wreckage of your disregard.
Sinking down and waiting.
For a chance to feel alive.
.
Now in my remains.
Are promises that never came.
Set this silence free.
To wash away the worst of me.
.
Like an army.
Falling.
One by one by one.
Like an army.
Falling.
One by one by one.
Like an army.
Falling.
One by one by one.
Like an army.
Falling.
One by one by one.
.
Now in my remains.
Are promises that never came.
Set this silence free.
To wash away the worst of me.
.
Like an army.
Falling.
One by one by one.
Like an army.
Falling.
One by one by one.
.
.
Telling me to go.
But hands beg me to stay.
Your lips say that you love.
Your eyes say that you hate.
.
There's truth in your lies.
Doubt in your faith.
What you build you lay to waste.
There's truth in your lies.
Doubt in your faith.
All I've got's what you didn't take.
.
So I, I won't be the one.
Be the one to leave this.
In pieces.
And you, you will be alone.
Alone with all your secrets.
And regrets.
Don't lie.
.
You promise me the sky.
Then toss me like a stone.
You wrap me in your arms.
And chill me to the bone.
.
There's truth in your lies.
Doubt in your faith.
All I've got's what you didn't take.
.
So I, I won't be the one.
Be the one to leave this.
In pieces.
And you, you will be alone.
Alone with all your secrets.
And regrets.
Don't lie.
.
So I, I won't be the one.
Be the one to leave this.

And you, you will be alone.
Alone with all your secrets.
And regrets.
Don't lie.

It starts with one thing.
I don't know why.
It doesn't even matter how hard you try.
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme.
To explain in due time.
All I know.
Time is a valuable thing.
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings.
Watch it count down to the end of the day.
The clock ticks life away.
.
It's so unreal.
Didn't look out below.
Watch the time go right out the window.
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know.
I wasted it all just to watch you go.
I kept everything inside.
And even though I tried, it all fell apart.
What it meant to me.
Will eventually be a memory of a time when.
.
I tried so hard.
And got so far.
But in the end.
It doesn't even matter.
I had to fall.
To lose it all.

One thing, I don't know why.
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,.
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,.
To remind myself of a time when.
I tried so hard.
In spite of the way you were mocking me.
Acting like I was part of your property.
Remembering all the times you fought with me.
I'm surprised it got so.
Things aren't the way they were before.
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore.
Not that you knew me back then.
But it all comes back to me in the end.
I kept everything inside.
And even though I tried, it all fell apart.
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when.

I've got an aching head.
Echoes and buzzing noises.
I know the words we said.
But wish I could've turned our voices down.
This is not black and white.
Only organize confusion.
I'm just trying to get it right.
And in spite of all I should've done.
.
I was not mad at you.
I was not trying to tear you down.
The words that I could've used.
I was too scared to say out loud.
If I cannot break your fall.
I'll pick you up right off the ground.
If you felt invisible, I won't let you feel that now.
.
Invisible.
Invisible.
Invisible.
Invisible.
.
You didn't get your way.
And it's an empty feeling.
You've got a lot to say.
And you just want to know you're being hurt.
But this is not black and white.
There are no clear solutions.
I'm just trying to get it right.

When you were standing in the wake of devastation.
When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown.
And with the cataclysm raining down, insides crying save me now.
You were there impossibly alone.
.
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation.
You build up hope but failure's all you've known.
Remember all the sadness and frustration.
And let it go, let it go.
.
And in the burst of light that blinded every angel.
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars.
You felt the gravity of temper grace falling into empty space.
No one there to catch you in their arms.
.
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation.
You build up hope but failure's all you've known.
Remember all the sadness and frustration.
And let it go, let it go.

Oh my sun it won't shine.
It won't light up the back of my mind.
And these fires they won't burn.
But to blacken the memories I've earned.
.
And these walls are so thin.
But they somehow keep holdin' me in.
'Cause I've pushed and I know.
What's to come at the end of this road.
.
'Cause it goes through through.
.
Well, my sun it won't shine.
It won't light up the back of my mind.
And these fires they don't burn.
Except to blacken the memories I've earned.
.
And these walls are so thin.
But they keep on holdin' me in.
'Cause I've pushed and I know.
That there's nowhere left to go.

'Cause it goes through through.

'Cause it goes through through.

'Cause it goes through through.

'Cause it goes through through.

The cycle repeated.
As explosions broke in the sky.
All that I needed.
Was the one thing I couldn't find.
And you were there at the turn.
Waiting to let me know.
.
We're building it up.
To break it back down.
We're building it up.
To burn it down.
We can't wait.
To burn it to the ground.
.
The colors conflicted.
As the flames, climbed into the clouds.
I wanted to fix this.
But couldn't stop from tearing it down.
And you were there at the turn.
Caught in the burning glow.
And I was there at the turn.
Waiting to let you know.
.
We're building it up.
To break it back down.
We're building it up.
To burn it down.
We can't wait.
To burn it to the ground.
.
You told me yes.
You held me high.
And I believed when you told that lie.
I played soldier, you played king.
And struck me down, when I kissed that ring.
You lost that right, to hold that crown.
I built you up, but you let me down.
So when you fall, I'll take my turn.
And fan the flames.
As your blazes burn.
.
And you were there at the turn.
Waiting to let me know.
.
We're building it up.
To break it back down.
We're building it up.
To burn it down.
We can't wait.

Was hurtin 'em in the home of the Terrapins, got it dirt cheap for them.
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them.
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them.
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthin 'em.
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A.
Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so freezy.
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me.
Haters want me clapped and chromed, it ain't easy.
Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in.
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky.
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A.
Not guilty, he who does not feel me.
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist.
So poof, vamoose, son of a bitch!.

Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings.
Watch it count down to the end of the day.
The clock ticks life away and (It's so unreal).
I didn't look out below.
I watch the time go right out the window.
Trying to hold on, and didn't even know.
I wasted it all just to (Watch you go).
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart.
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried, so.

Motherfuckers wanna act loco, hit 'em up.
Numerous shots with the fo'-fo'.
Faggots wanna talk to Po-Po's, smoke 'em like cocoa.
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload.
Fuck that, on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed.
Left holes through some guy clothes.
Stop your bullshittin, Glock with the full clip.
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit.
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip.
See the nigga laying shocked when the fool hit.
Hey ma, how you, know niggas wanna buy you.
But see me I wanna "Fuck for Free" like Akinyele.
Take this ride, make you feel it inside your belly.
If it's tight get the K-Y Jelly.
All night get you wide up inside the telly.
Side to side, til you say Jay-Z you're too much for me.
.
I am, a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard.
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact.
That everybody can see these scars.
I am, what I want you to want, what I want you to feel.
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you.
To just believe this is real.
So I, let go, watching you, turn your back like you always do.
Face away and pretend that I'm not.
But I'll be here cause you're all that I've got.
.
Got a condo with nothin' but condoms in it.
The same place where the rhymes is invented.
So all I do is rap and sex, imagine how I stroke.
See how I was flowin' on my last cassette?.
Rapid-fire like I'm blastin' a Tec, never jam though.
Never get high, never run out of ammo.
Niggas hatin' the shit cause I slayed your bitch.
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick.
And now you're, actin raw but you never had war.
Don't know how to carry your hoes, wanna marry your ho.
Now she's mad at me cause Your Majesty.
Just happened to be a pimp, what a tragedy.
She wanted, us to end, cause I fucked with friends.
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again.
I seen her tears as she busted in, I said, "Shit.
There's a draft, shut the door bitch and come on in!".
.
I am, a little bit insecure, a little unconfident.
Cause you don't understand I do what I can.
Sometimes I don't make sense.
I am, what you never wanna say, but I've never had a doubt.
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me out.
So I, let go, watching you, turn your back like you always do.
You face away and pretend that I'm not.
I'll be here cause you're all that I've got.
.
I can't feel, the way I did before.
Don't turn your back on me.
I won't be ignored.
Time won't heal, this damage anymore.
Don't turn your back on me.
I won't be ignored.

I'm kicking in the twilight as she comes.
Time waits at a darling.
Spooning the thickness and feeding our open mouths.

The price you pay is always.

Too high, I'm too familiar.

No control / no surprise.
Tossed the keys to the kingdom.
Down that hole in my eye.
I'm my own / casualty.
I fuck up everything I see.
Fighting in futility.
.
We start the final war.
Tell me what's worth fighting for.
When we know there's nothing more.
We take the hand or fist.
Just to sell ourselves for this.
The path we least resist.
.
No control / no surprise.
Tossed the keys to the kingdom.
Down that hole in my eye.
I'm my own / casualty.
I fuck up everything I see.

I give you what you came for / this is not the same though.
Got a different method but I still can bring the pain so.
Y'all stuck in that same flow / I got that insane flow.
High as y'all can get you're never really in my range though.
Yes I'm half anglo / half fried panko.
All prime-time rhymer / let the bass bang low.
All you fucking lames go / aiming at my name, know.
Careful what you shoot because you might hit what you aim for.
.
No control / no surprise.
Tossed the keys to the kingdom.
Down that hole in my eye.
I'm my own / casualty.
I'm my own.
Casualty.

I dreamed I was missing.
You were so scared.
But no one would listen.
Cause no one else cared.
After my dreaming.
I woke with this fear.
What am I leaving.
When I'm done here?.
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know.
.
When my time comes.
Forget the wrong that I've done.
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed.
And don't resent me.
And when you're feeling empty.
Keep me in your memory.
Leave out all the rest.
Leave out all the rest.
.
Don't be afraid.
I've taken my beating.
I've shared what I've made.
I'm strong on the surface.
Not all the way through.
I've never been perfect.
But neither have you.
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know.

Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed.

So conditioned I could never let go.
Then sorrow, then sickness.
Then the shock when you flip it on me.
So hollow, so vicious.
So afraid I couldn't let myself see.
That I could never be held.
Back up, no, I'll hold myself.
Check the rep, yep you know my rail.
Forget the rest let them know my hell.
Damn, I'm back yep, my soul ain't sell,.
Kept respect up the vets stay their,.
Let the rest be to tell they tale.
That I was there saying.
.
And these promises broken.
Deep, feeble.
Each word gets lost in the echo.
So one last lie I can see through.
This time I finally let you.
Go, go, go.
.
Test my will, test my heart.
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up.
Y'all go hard, I go smart.
How's it working out for y'all in the back, huh?.
I've seen that frustration.
Big cross, they're lost but don't know.
And I've come back unshaken.
Let down, I've lived and let go.
So you can let it be known.
I don't hold back, I hold my own.
I can't be mad, I can't be calm.
I can't sing flat, it ain't my tone.
I can't fall back, I came too far.
Hold myself up and love my scars.
Let the bells ring wherever they are.
'Cause I was there saying.
.
And these promises broken.
Deep, feeble.
Each word gets lost in the echo.
So one last lie I can see through.
This time I finally let you.
Go, go, go.
.
No, you can tell 'em all now.
I don't back up, I don't back down.
I don't fold up, and I don't bow.
I don't roll over, don't know how.
I don't care where the enemies are.
Can't be stopped, all I know go hard!.
Won't forget how I got this far.
And every time, saying.
.
And these promises broken.
Deep, feeble.
Each word gets lost in the echo.
So one last lie I can see through.
This time I finally let you.
Go, go, go.
.

When I pretend everything is what I want it to be.
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see.
When I pretend I can forget about the criminal I am.
Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can,.
But I can't pretend this is the way it will stay,.
I'm just trying to bend the truth.
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be so I'm.
Lying my way from you.
.
(No, no turning back now).
I want to be pushed aside so let me go (no, no turning back now).
Let me take back my life I'd rather be all alone (no turning back now).
Anywhere on my own 'cause I can see (no, no turning back now).
The very worst part of you is me.
.
I remember what they taught to me.
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be.
Remember listening to all of that and this again.
So I pretended up a person who was fitting in.
And now you think this person really is me and I'm.
(Trying to bend the truth).
But the more I push the more I'm pulling away.
'Cause I'm lying my way from you.

(No, no turning back now).

The very worst part of you.
Is me.

This isn't what I wanted to be.
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me.
Like this.

Where's my fucking frappuccino.
All right let's do this.

When I pretend, everything is what I want it to be.
I looked exactly like what you always wanted to see.

Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can, but.

I can't pretend of who you want me to be so I'm (lying my way from).

If you feelin' like a pimp nigga, go and brush your shoulders off.
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off.
Niggas is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you.
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder.

I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force.
Tryin' to hustle some things, that go with the Porsche.
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced.
Middle finger to the law, nigga grippin' my balls.
Said the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'.
All the ballers is bouncin they like the way I be leanin.
All the rappers be hatin, off the track that I'm makin'.
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it.
Came from the bottom the bottom, to the top of the pops.
Nigga London, Japan and I'm straight off the block.

Your homey Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda.
I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover.
Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yes sir.
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya.
But like, fifty-two cards when I'm, I'm through dealin.
Now fifty-two bars come out, now you feel 'em.
Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling.
In case fifty-two broads come out, now you chillin.
With a boss bitch of course S.C. On the sleeve.
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen.
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean.
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real, chill.
.
Yeah, I remember what they taught to me.
Remember condescending took for who I ought to be.
Remember listenin' to all of that and this again.
So I pretended up a person who was fitting in.

You (Nah, no turning back now).

There's a fragile game we play.
With the ghosts of yesterday.
If we can't let go we'll never say goodbye.
No trace of what remains.
No stones to mark the graves.
Only memories we thought we could deny.
.
There was so much more to lose.
Than the pain I put you through.
In my carelessness I left you in the dark.
And the blood may wash away.
But the scars will never fade.
At least I know somehow I made a mark.
.
In the dark.
In the light.
Nothing left.
Nothing right.
.
In the dark.
In the light.
Nothing left.
Nothing right!.

The dark.

Nothing left.
Nothing right.

Caught up against the wall again.
Time to chill in the bar again.
Never seize to amaze the night.
So I just sleep sleep sleep please don't.
Wake me till the morning after.
Wake me till the morning after.
.
.
Cut and bruised by the fall again.
Lick my wounds like a dog again.
Is that a light at the end of the tunnel.
That I see I see please let it be but don't.
Wake me till the morning after.
Wake me till the morning after.
Wake me till the morning after.

I'm so tired there has got to be an end.
to the pain I feel when I'm.
awake and alive alive alive alive.

I never liked the shelter.
I'm constantly alone.
I'm pointing out my weakness.
There's an emptiness at home.
.
I need to find a reason.
To live this way.
I'm running out of patience.
And my life is over.
.
I'm standing here.
But I'm on my way.
Searching to find an answer.
I'm standing here.
But it's all the same.
And I'm running out of patience.
.
And I will take my reason.
From you.
And I have gained a reason.
From you.
.
But you left me.
You left me here.
And I'm all alone.
.
I've been stripped of my innocence.
I take pity in myself.
A certain chain of events.
That have left me in this hell.
I need to find a reason.
To live this way.
I'm running out of patience.
And my life is over.
.
I'm standing here.
But I'm on my way.
Searching to find an answer.
I'm standing here.
But it's all the same.

From you.
And I have gained a reason.
From you.
.
But you left me.
You left me here.
And I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
I'm all alone.
.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
.
Well I'm searching.
To find my reason.
To find a reason.
To find my reason.
Why I need you.
And I need you.
And I want you.
But I need to.
Get away from you.
And I need you.
And I want you.
But I need to.
Get away from you.
And I need you.
And I want you.
But I need to.
Get away from you.
And I need you.
And I want you.
But I need to.
Get away from you.
.
And I will take my reason.
From you.
And I needed someone to love me.
But you just left me.
Here and I'm lonely.
You know I needed.
Someone to love me.
But I'm all alone.
.
.
I remembered black skies.
The lightning all around me.
I remembered each flash.
As time began to blur.
Like a startling sign.
That fate had finally found me.
.
And your voice was all I heard.
That I get what I deserve.
.
So give me reason.
To prove me wrong.
To wash this memory clean.
Let the floods cross.
The distance in your eyes.
.
Give me reason.
To fill this hole.
Connect the space between.
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies.
Across this new divide.
.
There was nothing in sight.
But memories left abandoned.
There was nowhere to hide.
The ashes fell like snow.
And the ground caved in.
Between where we were standing.
.
And your voice was all I heard.
That I get what I deserve.
.
So give me reason.
To prove me wrong.
To wash this memory clean.
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes.
Across this new divide.
.
In every loss.
In every lie.
In every truth that you'd deny.
And each regret.
And each goodbye.
Was a mistake to great to hide.
.
And your voice was all I heard.
That I get what I deserve.
.
So give me reason.
To prove me wrong.
To wash this memory clean.
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes.
.
Give me reason.
To fill this hole.
Connect the space between.
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies.
Across this new divide.
.
Across this new divide.
Across this new divide.

God damn it, I'm not gonna do no laundry.
Said God damn it, I'm not gonna do no laundry.
.
Everybody knows.
I don't do no God damn clothes.
.
The laundry, the laundry.
The laundry, the laundry.
.
Oh, I ain't gonna do no laundry...Bitch!.
.
.
.
Are you lost.
In your lies?.
Do you tell yourself "I don't realize"?.
.
Your crusade's a disguise.
Replace freedom with fear.
You trade money for lives.
.
I'm aware of what you've done.
.
No, no more sorrow.
I've paid for your mistakes.
Your time is borrowed.
Your time has come to be replaced.
.
I see pain.
I see need.
I see liars and thieves.
Abused power with greed.
I had hope.
I believed.
But I'm beginning to think that I've been deceived.
.
You will pay for what you've done.
.
No, no more sorrow.
I've paid for your mistakes.
Your time is borrowed.
Your time has come to be replaced.
.
Thieves and hypocrites!.
Thieves and hypocrites!.
Thieves and hypocrites!.

No, no more sorrow.
I've paid for your mistakes.
Your time is borrowed.
Your time has come to be replaced.
.
No more sorrow.
I've paid for your mistakes.
Your time is borrowed.
Your time has come to be replaced!.
Your time has come to be replaced!.
Your time has come to be erased!.
.
.
Standing alone with no direction.
How did I fall so far behind'.
Why am I searching for perfection.
Knowing it's something I won't find'.
.
In my fear and flaws.
I let myself down again.
All because I run.
'Til the silence splits me open, I run.
'Til it puts me underground.
'Til I have no breath.
And no roads left but one.
.
When did I lose my sense of purpose'.
Can I regain what's lost inside'.
Why do I feel like I deserve this'.
Why does my pain look like my pride'.
.
In my fear and flaws.
I let myself down again.
All because I let myself down.
.
In my fear and flaws, I run.
'Til the silence splits me open, I run.
'Til it puts me underground.
'Til I have no breath.
And no roads left but one.
No roads left but one.
.
In my fear and flaws.
I let myself down again.
All because I run.
And the silence splits me open, I run.
And it puts me underground.
But there's no regret.
And no roads left to run.
.
.
I'm dancing with my demons.
I'm hanging off the edge.
Storm clouds gather beneath me.
Waves break above my head.
.
Headfirst hallucination.
I wanna fall wide awake now.
.
You tell me it's alright.
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight.
But nobody can save me now.
I'm holding up a light.
Chasing out the darkness inside.
Cause nobody can save me.
.
Stared into this illusion.
For answers yet to come.
I chose a false solution.
But nobody proved me wrong, no.
.
Headfirst hallucination.
I wanna fall wide awake.
Watch the ground giving way now.
.
You tell me it's alright.
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight.
But nobody can save me now.
I'm holding up a light.
I'm chasing out the darkness inside.
Cause nobody can save me.
.
Been searching somewhere out there.
For what's been missing right here.
(I wanna fall wide awake now).
I've been searching somewhere out there.
For what's been missing right here.
.
I wanna fall wide awake now.
.
So tell me it's alright.
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight.
And only I can save me now.
I'm holding up a light.
I'm chasing out the darkness inside.
And I don't wanna let you down.
But only I can save me.
.
Been searching somewhere out there.
For what's been missing right here.

Come, come, come, coming at you,.
Come, coming at you,.
Come, coming at you,.
Peep the style and the kids checking for it.
The number one question is how could you ignore it.
We drop right back in the cut over basement tracks.
With raps that got you backing this up like (rewind that).
We're just rolling with the rhythm.
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division.
With these non-stop lyrics of life living.
Not to forgotten but still unforgiven.
But in the meantime there are those who want to.
Talk this and that, so I suppose.
It gets to a point feelings gotta get hurt.
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt.
.
Try to give you warning but everyone ignores me.
(Told you everything loud and clear).
But nobody's listening call to you so clearly.
But you don't want to hear me.
(Told you everything loud and clear).
But nobody's listening.
.
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress.
Handful of anger, held in my chest.
And everything's left is a waste of time.
I hate my rhymes (but hate everyone else's more).
I'm riding on the back of this pressure.
Guessing that it's better I can't keep myself together.
Because all of this stress gave me something to write on.
The pain gave me something I could set my sights on.
You never forget the blood, sweat, and tears.
The uphill struggle over the years.
The fear and trash talking.
And the people it was to.
And the people that started it.
Just like you.
.
Try to give you warning but everyone ignores me.
(Told you everything loud and clear).
But nobody's listening.
Call to you so clearly but you don't want to hear me.
(Told you everything loud and clear).
But nobody's listening.
.
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress.
Handful of anger, held in my chest.
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears.
Nothing to gain, everything to fear.
.
A heart full of pain, head full of stress.
Handful of anger, held in my chest.
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears.
Nothing to gain, everything to fear.
.
A heart full of pain, a heart full of pain.
Try to give you warning but everyone ignores me.
(Told you everything loud and clear).
But nobody's listening.
Call to you so clearly but you don't want to hear me.
(Told you everything loud and clear).
But nobody's listening.
.
A heart full of pain, head full of stress.
But nobody's listening.
Handful of anger, held in my chest.
Nobody's listening.
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears.
Nobody's listening.
Nothing to gain, everything to fear.
But nobody's listening.
Come, come, come, coming at you.
Come, come, come, coming at you.
Come, come, come, coming at you.
Come, come, come, coming at you.
.
.
I break down, fear is sinking in.
The cold comes, racing through my skin.
Searching for a way to get to you.
Through the storm you.
Go, giving up your home.
Go, leaving all you've known.
You are not alone.
.
With arms up, stretched into the sky.
With eyes like, echoes in the night.
Hiding from the hell that you've been through.
Silent one, you.
Go, giving up your home.
Go, leaving all you've known.
.
You go, giving up your home.
Go, leaving all you've known.
You are not alone.
.
You go, giving up your home.
Go, leaving all you've known.
.
You go, giving up your home.
Go, you are not alone.
You are not alone.
.
You are not alone.

I'm tired of being what you want me to be.
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface.
I don't know what you're expecting of me.
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes.
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow.
Every step that I take is another mistake to you.
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow.
.
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there.
Become so tired, so much more aware.
By becoming this all I want to do.
Is be more like me and be less like you.
.
Can't you see that you're smothering me?.
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control.
'Cause everything that you thought I would be.
Has fallen apart right in front of you.
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow.
Every step that I take is another mistake to you.
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow.
And every second I waste is more than I can take!.
.
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there.
Become so tired, so much more aware.
By becoming this all I want to do.
Is be more like me and be less like you.
.
And I know I may end up failing too.
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you.
.
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there.
Become so tired, so much more aware.
By becoming this all I want to do.
Is be more like me and be less like you.
.
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there.
I'm tired of being what you want me to be.
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there.
I'm tired of being what you want me to be.
.
.
Yeah.
.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You're far too kind.
.
Can I get an encore, do you want more.
Cooking raw with the Brooklyn boy.
So for one last time I need y'all to roar.
.
Now what the hell are you waiting for?.
.
After me, there shall be no more.
So for one last time, make some noise.
.
Get em Jay.
.
Who you know fresher than Hov? Riddle me that.
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at.
Can't none of y'all mirror me back.
Yeah hearing me rap is like hearing G. Rap in his prime.
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead.
Back to take over the globe, now break bread.
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express.
Out the country but the Blueberry still connect.
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck.
But when you young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep.
Grand opening, grand closing.
God damn your man Hov cracked the can open again.
Who you goin' find doper than him with no pen.
Just draw off inspiration.
Soon you goin' see you can't replace him.
With cheap imitations for these generations.
.
Can I get an encore, do you want more.
Cooking raw with the Brooklyn boy.
So for one last time I need y'all to roar.

Now what the hell are you waiting for?.

After me, there shall be no more.
So for one last time, make some noise.
.
What the hell are you waiting for?.
.
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you.
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you.
When you first come in the game, they try to play you.
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you.
From Marcy to Madison Square.
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yea).
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears.
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye.
When I come back like Jordan, wearing the 4-5.
It ain't to play games with you.
It's to aim at you, probably maim you.
If I owe you I'm blowing you to smithereens.
Cocksucker take one for your team.
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing).
I came, I saw, I conquered.
From record sales, to sold out concerts.
So motherfucker if you want this encore.
I need you to scream, till your lungs get sore.
.
I'm tired of being what you want me to be.
Feeling so faithless.
Lost under the surface.
I don't know what you're expecting of me.
Put under the pressure.
Of walking in your shoes.
.
Caught in the undertow.
Just caught in the undertow.
Every step that I take is another mistake to you.
Caught in the undertow.
Just caught in the undertow.
And every second I waste is more than I can take.
.
I've become so numb.
I can't feel you there.
Become so tired.
So much more aware.
I'm becoming this.
All I want to do.
Is be more like me.
And be less like you.
.
I've become so numb.
Can I get an encore, do you want more? (More, more, more).
.
I've become so numb.
For one last time I need y'all to roar (One last time I need y'all to roar).
.
.
[Instrumental].
.
.
Should've stayed. Were the signs I ignored?.
Can I help you not to hurt anymore?.
We saw brilliance when the world was asleep..
There are things that we can have but can't keep..
.
If they say....
Who cares if one more light goes out?.
In the sky of a million stars,.
It flickers, flickers..
Who cares when someone's time runs out?.
If a moment is all we are,.
Or quicker, quicker..
Who cares if one more light goes out?.
Well I do..
.
The reminders pull the floor from your feet..
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh..
And you're angry. And you should be. It's not fair..
Just cause you can't see it doesn't mean it isn't there..
.
If they say....
Who cares if one more light goes out?.
In the sky of a million stars,.
It flickers, flickers..
Who cares when someone's time runs out?.
If a moment is all we are,.
Or quicker, quicker..
Who cares if one more light goes out?.
Well I do..
.
I do....
.
Who cares if one more light goes out?.
In the sky of a million stars,.
It flickers, flickers..
Who cares when someone's time runs out?.

Well I do..

It was nothing but a fantasy (I knew it).
But I had a lot of fun before (I blew it).
Isn't that what everybody says.
That you can't eat the cake if you piss on it.
.
I put my money on a card roulette.
And I kept my smile as I placed my bet.
I knew what I did when I went on the ride.
It's a 5-align credit on the wild side.
.
You showed me how.
It was too good to be true.
And that I should grow up.
And start sniffing the glue.
.
But it's all around me.
To the left and the right.
And it's eating me up.
And spitting me out.
.
If you've never seen a failure then here's one!.
I was doomed before I ever begun.
I was onboard drinking.
When Titanic went down.
And the band played on as I ordered a round.
.
That's just how it goes.
Don't you think I know?.
You don't have to tell it to my face (tell it to my face).
I won't stop the show.
I just let it flow.
You don't have to tell it to my face (tell it to my face).
.
I don't ever want to stand in line (you get it?).
Cause I could find a better waste of time (you bet it).
Everybody wants a piece of the pie.
So I take what I want and I never ask why.
.
If you wondered what would make me up.
Then you'll self-combust if you smell the glove.
I'm a time bomb running out of batteries.
And with fellows like you.
I don't need no enemies.
.
That's just how it goes.
Don't you think I know?.
You don't have to tell it to my face (tell it to my face).
I won't stop the show.
I just let it flow.
You don't have to tell it to my face (tell it to my face).
.
(Tell it to my face).
.
(Tell it to my face!).
That's just how it goes.
Don't you think I know?.
You don't have to tell it to my face (tell it to my face).
I won't stop the show.
I just let it flow.
You don't have to tell it to my face (tell it to my face).
.
That's just how it goes.
Don't you think I know?.
You don't have to tell it to my face (tell it to my face).
I won't stop the show.
I just let it flow.
You don't have to tell it to my face (tell it to my face).
.
(Tell it to my face).
(Tell it to my face).
(Tell it to my face).

I cannot take this anymore.
I'm saying everything I've said before.
All these words they make no sense.
I find bliss in ignorance.
Less I hear the less you'll say.
But you'll find that out anyway.
Just like before.
.
Everything you say to me.
Takes me one step closer to the edge.
And I'm about to break.
I need a little room to breathe.
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge.
And I'm about to break.
.
I find the answers aren't so clear.
Wish I could find a way to disappear.
All these thoughts they make no sense.
I find bliss in ignorance.
Nothing seems to go away.
Over and over again.
Just like before.
.
Everything you say to me.
Takes me one step closer to the edge.
And I'm about to break.
I need a little room to breathe.
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge.
And I'm about to break.
.
Everything you say to me.
Takes me one step closer to the edge.
And I'm about to break.
I need a little room to breathe.
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge.
And I'm about to, break.
.
Shut up when I'm talking to you.
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
Shut up when I'm talking to you.
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
Shut up, I'm about to break!.
.
Everything you say to me.
Takes me one step closer to the edge.
And I'm about to break.
I need a little room to breathe.
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge.
And I'm about to break.
.
Everything you say to me.
Takes me one step closer to the edge.
And I'm about to break.
I need a little room to breathe.

Hear the voices in my head.
I pretend it's all okay.
(Do you hear the voices in my head?).
Always.
.
When you consider a war.
Cos you don't get what you want to.
Remember the fact.
You don't know what I'm in for.
Squeeze the hex you breathe in me.
And there's nothing undesired.
.
Hey, don't try to understand.
They take the upper hand.
(Do you hear the voices in my head?).
Always.
(Always, oh yeah).
.
[chorus].
I try so hard but I can never find.
The answers lost upon the other side.
I'm bleeding out before I'm coming out.
Didn't mean to break in on the outside.
I try so hard but I can never find.
The answers lost upon the other side.
I'm bleeding out before I'm coming out.
Didn't mean to break in on the outside.
.
Here, I'm locked inside my head.
You can't help me understand.
(Do you hear the voices in my head?).
Deny the things I say, always.
.
When you dream of a fan.
Cos you don't know where they come from.
Consider the facts.
When they're moving in behind ya.
Squeeze the hex you breathe in me.
And there's nothing we deny ya.
.
I try so hard but I can never find.
The answers lost upon the other side.
I'm bleeding out before I'm coming out.
Didn't mean to break in on the outside.
I try so hard but I can never find.
The answers lost upon the other side.
I'm bleeding out before I'm coming out.
Didn't mean to break in on the outside.
.
Do you hear the voices in my head? (4x).
.
I try so hard but I can never find.
The answers lost upon the other side.
I'm bleeding out before I'm coming out.
Didn't mean to break in on the outside.
I try so hard but I can never find.
The answers lost upon the other side.
I'm bleeding out before I'm coming out.
Didn't mean to break in on the outside.

When I look into your eyes.
There's nothing there to see.
Nothing but my own mistakes.
Staring back at me.
.
.
Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwhind.
Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down.
Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwhind.
Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down.
.
I've lied.
To you.
This is the last smile.
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you.
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down).
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwhind).
For sake of being with you.
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down).
The sacrifice is never knowing.
.
Why I stayed with you.
Just push away.
No matter what you see.
You're still so blind to me.
.
.
I've tried.
Like you.
To do everything you wanted to.
This is the last time.
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you.
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down).
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie.
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwind).
The sacrifice is never knowing.
.
Why I stayed with you.
Just push away.
No matter what you see.
You're still so blind to me.
.
Reverse phsycology's failing miserably.
It's so hard to be, left all alone.
Telling you is the only chance for me.
there's nothing left but, to turn and face you.
When I look into your eyes, there's nothing there to see.
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me.
Asking why....
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie (why).
The sacrifice is never knowing.
.
Why I stayed with you.
Just push away.
No matter what you see.
You're still so blind to me.
Why I stayed with you.
Just push away.
No matter what you see.
You're still so blind to me.

Why does it feel like night today?.
Something in the air's not right today.
Why am I so uptight today?.
Paranoia's all I got left.
I don't know what stressed me first.
Or how the pressure was fed.
But I know just what it feels like.
To have a voice in the back of my head.
Like a face that I hold inside.
A face that awakes when I close my eyes.
A face watches every time I lie.
A face that laughs every time I fall.
(It watches everything).
So I know now when it's time to sink or swim.
That the face inside is hearing me.
Right beneath my skin.
.
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back.
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head.
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within.
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin.
.
I know I've got a face in me.
Points out all my mistakes to me.
You've got a face on the inside too.
Your paranoia's probably worse.
I don't know what set me off first but I know what I can't stand.
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is.
I can't add up to what you can but.
Everybody has a face that they hold inside.
A face that awakes when I close my eyes.
A face that watches every time they lie.
A face that laughs every time they fall.
(It watches everything).
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim.
That the face inside is watching you too.
Right inside your skin.
.
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back.
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head.
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within.
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin.
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back.
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head.
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within.
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin.
.
The face inside is right beneath your skin.
The face inside is right beneath your skin.
The face inside is right beneath your skin.
.
The sun goes down.
I feel the light betray me.
The sun goes down.
I feel the light betray me.
.
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back.
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head.
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within.
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin.
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back.
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head.
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within.
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within.
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within.
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin.

Part of me won't go away.
Everyday reminded how much I hate it.
Weighted against the consequences.
Can't live without it so it's senseless.
Wanna cut it out of my soul.
And just live with a gaping hole.
Take control of my life.
And wash out all the burnt taste.
I made the problems in the first place.
Hang my head low cause it's part of me.
You hardly see right next to the heart of me.
Heard of me, the routine scar.
New cuts cover where the old ones are.
And now I'm sick of this.
I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts that grate on my sanity.
I rather not even be then the man that's staring in the mirror through me.
.
Cut myself free willingly.
Stop just what's killing me.
.
I feel it everyday.
I feel I made my way.
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside, swallowing me.
.
Freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it.
Once it's been dealt with you feel like you've been touched by something angelic.
And then melted down into a pool of peace.
Cease to be the animal you used to be.
Remove the broken parts you know were wrong.
And feel the calm when the problem's all gone.
And then you start to see another piece of yourself that you can't let be.
Memories of the last fight to free yourself.
Take it to the depths of the bottom of the well.
And now you know that you can choose to lose the part in your heart.
Where your insides bruise.
You can live if you're willing to.
Put a stop to just what's killing you.
.
Alive in me, inside of me, a part of me screams away silently.
This part of me won't go away, part of me won't go away.
.
Everywhere I look around I see how everyone aught to be.
Every time I see myself I see there's always something wrong with me.
.
.
Part of me won't go away.
Everyday reminded how much I hate it.
Weighted against the consequences.
Can't live without it so it's senseless.
Wanna cut it out of my soul.
And just live with a gaping hole.
Find myself taking control.
Of the situation.
Responsible for its creation.
Hang my head low cause it's part of me.
You hardly see right hand to the heart of me.
Heard of me the routine scar.
New cuts cover where the old ones are.
And now I'm sick of this.
I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts that grade on my sanity.
I rather not even be then the man that's staring in the mirror through me.
.
Cut myself free.
Willingly stop just what's killing me.
Cut myself free.
Willingly stop just what's killing me.
Cut myself free.
Willingly stop just what's killing me.
Cut myself free.
Willingly stop just what's killing me.
.
.
Chorus.
I feel it everyday.
I feel I'm in my way.
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside.
Swallowing me.
.
Freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it.
Once it's been dealt with you feel like you've been touched by something angelic.
and then melted down into a pool of peace.
Cease to be the animal you used to be.
Erect the gate of pain volition.
Feel the rain of resolution.
And then you start to see another piece of yourself that you can't let be.
And that reason will last fight to free yourself.
Take it to the depths of the bottom of the well.
And now you know you can choose to lose the part in your heart.
Where your insides bruise.
You can live if you're willing to.
Put a stop to just what's killing you.
.
Cut myself free.
Willingly stop just what's killing me.
Cut myself free.
Willingly stop just what's killing me.
Cut myself free.
Willingly stop just what's killing me.
Cut myself free.
Willingly stop just what's killing me.

Uh, this song's about jellyfish.
And their bellyfish.
Ain't no foolyfish.
I don't droolyfish.
Goes like this:.
.
Jelly, jelly, jellyfish.
When you squeeze me, I go squish.
Peanut butter jellyfish.
Put me onto your sandwich.
.
Said jelly, jelly, jellyfish.
When you squeeze me, I go squish.
'Cause I'm a jellyfish.
Yeah, I'm a jellyfish.
.
My friends are fish and they go to school.
They think I'm crazy and they think I'm cool.
'Cause I'm a jellyfish.
Yeah, I'm a jellyfish.
.
Jelly, jelly, jellyfish.
When you squeeze me, I go squish.
'Cause I'm a jellyfish.
Yeah, I'm a jellyfish.
.
Got no eyes, I got no head.
I've got no house, I got no bed.
'Cause I'm a jellyfish.
Yeah, I'm a jellyfish.

I watch how the moon.
sits in the sky in the dark night.
Shining with the light from the sun.
And the sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming.
The moon's going to owe it one.
It makes me think of how you act to me.
You do.
Favors and then rapidly, you just.
Turn around and start asking me about.
Things you want back from me.
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger.
Sick of you acting like I owe you this.
Find another place to feed your greed.
While I find a place to rest.
I want to be in another place.
I hate when you say you don't understand.
(You'll see it's not meant to be).
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy.
A place for my head.
.
Maybe someday I'll be just like you and.
Step on people like you do and.
Run away the people I thought I knew.
I remember back then who you were.
You used to be calm used to be strong.
Used to be generous but you should've known.
That you'd.
Wear out your welcome now you see.
How quiet it is all alone.
I'm so.
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger.
Sick of you acting like I owe you this.
Find another place to feed your greed.
While I find a place to rest.
I'm so.
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger.
Sick of you acting like I owe you this.
Find another place to feed your greed.
While I find a place to rest.

Go away.

But you flop that bod as you drop that bomb.
Take it to the john in your babylon.
Flushed down with the sound that you carry on..
I don't really give a dang you pissed on my lawn.
Took a dump like a punk now the battles on..

You hid your skeletons.
When I had shown you mine.
You woke the devil that.
I thought you left behind.
.
I saw the evidence,.
The crimson soaking through.
Ten thousand promises,.
Ten thousand ways to lose....
.
And you held it all.
But you were careless to let it fall.
You held it all.
And I was by your side powerless.

I watched you fall apart.
And chased you to the end.
I'm left an empty mess,.
That words can not defend.

Why's does it feel like night today?.
Something in here's not right today.
Why am I so uptight today?.
Paranoia's all I got left.
I don't know what stressed me first.
Or how the pressure was fed.
But I know just what it feels like.
To have a voice in the back of my head.
It's like a face that I hold inside.
A face that awakes when I close my eyes.
A face that watches everytime I lie.
A face that laughs everytime I fall.
(And watches everything).
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim.
That the face inside is hearing me right underneath my skin.
.
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back.
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head.
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within.
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin.
.
Hey yo.
Here we go again with the pain I feel isn't real but in my mind.
But I find myself in places with names but no faces.
My memory races at speeds hundred degrees.
My soul it bleeds devil must have planted the seed.
Now it feels like my backs against the wall I'm taking the fall.
Whenever I call nobody's responding at all.
But I don't know who I can trust their screaming my name.
I need somebody to help me out of the flames.
.
All I'm trying to do is just master me.
All I want to do is smoke a blaster beat.
But something keeps talking to me consciously.
Responsibly it keeps haunting me.
From dusk till dawn everything has something for ya.
That voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia.
Cold sweat shining on your face exposing your purpose.
And if I ripped off the skin I'd probably find another verse.
There's nothing worse the trying to pull yourself back up from the dead.
So I advise you listen to that voice in the back of your head.
.
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back.
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head.
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within.
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin.
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back.

The face inside is right beneath your skin.
The the face inside is right beneath your skin.

The sun goes down.
I feel the light betray me.
The sun goes down.
.
It's like I'm paranoid! (echoes).
I feel the light betray me.
The sun.
.
Can't stop what I'm hearing within.
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin.
.
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back.

You say that your proud of me.
And you take something out of me.
So predictable.
Why do I have to see through this.
Why do I have to take this.
Isn't there something I can do.
To make myself finally say this.
.
No you've taken this to far.
Exposing who you are.
For all to see.
You're not the one that you pretend to be.

You start with apologies.
Then take another shot at me.

Yeah....
I didn't think that I had a debt to pay.
'Til they came to take all I had left away.
You said you wouldn't put me to the test today.
But I remember you saying that yesterday.
There was a time when your mind wasn't out of control.
Every memory and confession pouring out of your soul.

Seems like we never were taught the right way.
Every other minute I fought for my place.
And dropped what I made and thought you might stay.
So, I'm guessing that you probably know.
When your inside's hollow then you ought to be cold.

Machete Undresser.
Stupid dope fresh tight shit resurrecter.
Top gun, Miramar, best of the bester.
Leaving emcee's in peace and rester.
Skill tester, the flex, the gunner.
The make funner.
the adversary make runner.
Make summer cold with rhymes I spit.
Kick a gift to a delinquent wit.
I be the prophet in my hands.
top it stop it.
feel like Rocky when I rock it.
Locked it down with this perverse verse.
Every fucking curse a burst of hurt.
Move crowds with physical fitness rhymes.
Coke heads couldn't do my lines.
I'm decorated like Christmas pines.
My battalion rocks.
Emcee's become silhouettes in chalk.
.

Reading my eyes will say it in many ways.
Losing my pride will save it in many days.

Hit the dirt.
Because the words I spit.
will do more than just rip your shirt.
I'll bitch slap your soul.
contact the track control.
You coming at me.
and cant hack it though.
So ridiculous.
Watching my crew get sick with this Wickedness,.
Pitch in this Lyrical viciousness.
Of crews and cliques,.
Made of men, and mistresses.
This is my life;.
The twilight and fight night.
And trying to see nothing but the highlights when I write.
These eyes on horizons,.
die for my song,.
cry rhymes in Krylon.
Fire on, move men telekinetically.
Esoterically beats become a clarity.
Feel my verities heroism and heracy.
And severe every emcee.
I see with severity.

In fear I'm drowning.
As my heart keeps pounding.
Striking on the step.
To hold on to what's left.
Hold on to the strings of reality.
Bouncing on my heel of prosperity.
Me by myself with a gleam in my eye.
Question it all wash by watching you die.
So hard to see it all fall through.
But it's too late nothing left to do.
.
Refugee, I'm an enemy of your belief.
Don't hate me, because I disagree.
.
Release me from a world unkind.
A world where the blind is leading the blind.
It's so unfair that I can't feel free.
That I have to be what you want me to be.
Shadows of the past keep stabbing my back.
Reminding me of when I slipped out of track.
They're wasting their time another morning dawning.
A time when the restless keeps on doing it.

Refugee, I'm an enemy of your belief.
Don't hate me, because I disagree.
Refugee, I'm an enemy of your belief.
Don't hate me, because I disagree.

Refugee, I'm an enemy of your belief.
Don't hate me, because I disagree.

From the top to the bottom.
Bottom to top I stop.
At the core of the rotten.
Stop and just what I thought.
The sun has escaped us.
So I'm bright in the sky.
And I'm far from rapist.
Look at why did try (2x).
.
From the thread to the needle, middle to end.
When skies cock back and shock that which couldn't defend.
The rain then sends dripping acidic questions.
Forcefully, the power of suggestion.
Then with the eyes tightly shut looking thought the rust and rotten dust.
A spot of light floods the floor.
And pours itself upon a world of pretend.
Then the eyes ease open and its dark again.
.
Chorus.
.
Bridge:.
In a minute you'll find me.
Eyes burn me up.
You say you'll never forget me.
But the lies have piled up.
.
Moving all around.
Screaming of the ups and downs.
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound.
And as wheels go round the sunset creeps past the.
Street lamps, cars, chain-links, and concrete.
A wind open grows and captures the eye.
Cry?s out yellow light as it passes it by.
A small black figure sits in front of a box.
Inside a box a rock with the needles on top.
.
Nothing stops in the slanted the chain.
The brains lose not knowing they were part of the game.
And the insides go but the box stays the same.
And shame, shovel up the pieces to the pain.
You could try to hide yourself in the world of pretend.
When the paper's crumbled up it can't be perfect again.
.
Chorus.
Bridge.
.
Yeah I got you got in the act.
You better step back.
Telling me that.
I seein' right through you (7x).

Bridge (2x).

Next message.
Hey, Mike, what's up?.
This is Roc, just asking you what's happening?.
I was just touching base, seeing how your Easter went.
Um, just seeing if you're going to see Joe sometime soon, too,.
Because he's got my keyboard that I've been trying to get back.
I've been trying to call him and he hasn't been returning any messages.
So I'm seeing what the best angle is to, you know, get it back.
Heyy dude this is a good idea to get a message around...i like that.

Graffiti sky, sky, sky [echo fade].
(I don't think you all ready).
.
Graffiti decorations under a sky of grey.
This constant apprehension still giving me away.
The lessons I've forgotten.
Inside of all I've learned.
Now I find myself in question.
(point the finger at me again).
Guilty by association.

I want to runaway.

Paper bags and angry voices under a sky of grey.
This constant apprehension won't seem to go away.

Hey yo.

Let me spit it to y'all who said I wasn't gonna make it.
Everytime I blaze it, ya'll the first to hate it.
My team rains supreme and stays strong.

Too many of y'all is dyin' for us so I gotta blaze it.
I'm still reppin BK, Brooklyn D and on.
Hell fire and family allienation.
Banging hits in the backyard.

Weep not for roads untraveled.
Weep not for paths left lone.
'Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end.
It's the worst kind of pain I've known.
.
Give up your heart left broken.
And let that mistake pass on.
'Cause the love that you lost wasn't worth what it cost.
And in time you'll be glad it's gone.
.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,.
whoa, whoa.
.
Weep not for roads untraveled.
Weep not for sights unseen.
May your love never end and if you need a friend,.
There's a seat here alongside me.
.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,.
Whoa, whoa.

You say you're not gonna fight.

You've got nothing left to lose.
So you say you're not gonna fight.
'Cause no one will fight for you.

You say the weight of the world.
Has kept you from letting go.
And you think compassion's a flaw.
And you'll never let it show.
And you're sure you've hurt in a way.
That no one will ever know.
.
But someday the weight of the world.
Will give you the strength to go.

Hold on, the weight of the world.
Will give you the strength to go.

Graffiti decorations.
Under the sky of dust.
A constant wave of tension.
On top of broken trust.
The lessons that you taught me.
I learned were never true.
.
Now I find myself in question.
They point the finger at me again.
Guilty by association.
You point the finger at me again.
.
I wanna run away.
Never say goodbye.
I wanna know the truth.
Instead of wondering why.
I wanna know the answers.
No more lies.
I wanna shut the door.
And open up my mind.
.
Paper bags and angry voices.
Under a sky of dust.
Another wave of tension.
Has more than filled me up.
All my talk of taking action.
These words were never true.

They point the finger at me again.
Guilty by association.
You point the finger at me again.

I close both locks below the window.
I close both blinds and turn away.
Sometimes solutions aren't so simple.
Sometimes goodbye's the only way, oh.
.
And the sun will set for you.
The sun will set for you.
And the shadow of the day.
Will embrace the world in gray.
And the sun will set for you.
.
In cards and flowers on your window.
Your friends all plead for you to stay.
Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple.
Sometimes goodbye's the only way, oh.
.
And the sun will set for you.
The sun will set for you.
And the shadow of the day.
Will embrace the world in gray.
And the sun will set for you.

Mama always told me don't you run.
"Don't you run with scissors, son.
You're gonna hurt someone".
Mama told me look before you leap.
Always think before you speak, and watch the friends you keep.
.
Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said.
.
Sharp edges have consequences, I.
Guess that I had to find out for myself.
Sharp edges have consequences, now.
Every scar is a story I can tell.
.
Should've played it safer from the start.
Loved you like a house of cards.
Let it fall apart.
But all the things I couldn't understand.
Never could've planned.
They made me who I am.
Put your nose in paperbacks.
Instead of smoking cigarettes.
These are years you're never getting back.
.
Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said.
.
Sharp edges have consequences, I.
Guess that I had to find out for myself.
Sharp edges have consequences, now.
Every scar is a story I can tell.
.
We all fall down.
We live somehow.
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
We all fall down.
We live somehow.
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh.

It won't be long until everybody knows.

I've seen her smiling.
The sunlight is shining on her now.
She couldn't stay here.
She knows you can't put her down.
.
You know she couldn't stay with you.
You know she had to go.
Even though she couldn't stay with you.
You know your not alone.
.
No matter what you think you did wrong.
(It won't be long until everybody knows).
She knew she had to go all along.

Skin to bone, steel to rust.
Ash to ashes, dust to dust.
Will tomorrow have it's way.
With the promises we made.
Skin to bone, steel to rust..
.
Ash to ashes, dust to dust.
Your deception, my disgust.
When your name is finally drawn,.
I'll be happy that you're gone.
Ash to ashes, dust to dust..
.
(Aah) Ash to ashes, dust to dust.
(Aah) Skin to bone and steel to rust.
.
Right to left, left to right.
Night to day and day to night.
As the starlight fades to gray,.
I'll be watching far away.
Right to left and left to right.
.
(Aah) Ash to ashes, dust to dust.
(Aah) Skin to bone and steel to rust.
.
Will tomorrow have it's way.
With the promises betrayed.
Skin to bone and steel to rust.
Skin to bone and steel to rust.
Skin to bone and steel to rust.
.
.
In the center of the silence.
Violent thought are thrown through.
The thick smoke of flickering lights that brighten the room.
All the things that you wanted to say.
Get lost and thrown away.
You debate and hesitate to speak your mind.
Can't turn back when you've crossed the line.
Sometimes the someone who just doesn't care.
Has to see you go to know you were there.
.
This is the sun behind the rain.
Even sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute.
I may have begun to run an endless race.
But I never look back when I begin it.
.
I know this is the sun behind the rain.
Even sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute.
I may have begun to run an endless race.
But I never look back when I begin it.
.
I know all of this will soon be gone.
You don't really have to prove them wrong.
.
Sometimes you've got no control of where you go.
Taken down a road you don't know.
And you feel so lost that you hide your face.
You don't recgonize the place you're in.
Sometimes the sun doesn't shine your way.
Sometimes the night doesn't turn to day.
But sometimes the light is so bright.
It burns through the night and keeps the sunlight at bay.
.
This is the sun behind the rain.
Even sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute.
I may have begun to run an endless race.
But I never look back when I begin it.
.
I know that this is the sun behind the rain.
Even sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute.
I may have begun to run an endless race.
But I never look back when I begin it.
.
I know all of this will soon be gone.
You don't really have to prove them wrong.
I know soon enough you'll make them see.
You'll be far away from them with me.
.
Follow the link to the chain without a name.
Steal the light the dark contains the reigns.
Taken away from the place you've been trapped.
Fake all you know to bring it all back.
.
This is the sun behind the rain.
Even sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute.
I may have begun to run an endless race.
But I never look back when I begin it.
.
I know that this is the sun behind the rain.
Even sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute.
I may have begun to run an endless race.
But I never look back when I begin it.

I know all of this will soon be gone.
You don't really have to prove them wrong.
I know soon enough you'll make them see.
You'll be far away from them alone with me.

[Young Buck].
Heyyyy! I gotta slow down.
I said we gotta slow down.
.
Let me take you back to high school, ninety-fo'.
When at least when a nigga had time to go.
Walk to the bus stop, sellin rocks on the way.
Lil' bad motherfucker with a pocket full of yay.
Fell in love with a shorty that was bad.
I would go and skip class just so I could see that ass.
But she was too fast, and I was too slow.
Cause she wanted a nigga who already had dough.
She found her a man who was like twenty-fo'.
But what she didn't know that he had plenty hoes.
She was too young; so now he got a new one.
Cause shorty went and bought her a new gun.
See when she catch this nigga she gon' do somethin.
Not fight, but shorty gon' shoot somethin.
But she never got a chance, a change of plans.
Shot herself in the back puttin the gun in her pants.
.
[Chorus: Young Buck].
Live life young nigga, quit tryin to be grown.
You gon' miss momma when she dead and gone.
So slow your roll - slow it down my nigga.
Slow your roll - slow down my nigga.
Live life lil' mama, quit tryin to be grown.
You gon' miss daddy when he dead and gone.
So slow your roll - c'mon gotta slow down.
Slow your roll - think you gotta slow down.
.
[Young Buck].
I got a graveyard tatted on my arm.
So I'ma just start with my uncle William Hahn.
My momma only brother, he served in the Navy.
He lost his life because the war made him crazy.
My nephew Shannen, 15 years old.
When I think how he died I get real cold.
Cause they found him in a field with some crack stones.
There was no flesh, it was just bones.
I was just home, with my cousin Craig.
And then I got a phone call said they found him dead.
So what's next, ain't went to Bizz funeral yet.
Instead of one casket I need two of them shits.
It don't quit, just when you think I'm seein better days.
My auntie just find that she got AIDS.
And it's fucked up, cause her life don't end.
And she locked up, so she dyin in the pen', damn.
.
[Chorus].
.
[Chester Bennington].
This can't be life, we're living.
Cause I don't wanna live no more.
I don't wanna live no morrrrrre.
This can't be life, we're living.
Cause I don't wanna live no more.
I don't wanna live no morrrrrre.
This can't be life we're living.
Cause I don't want it no morrrrrre, no morrrrrre.
This can't be life we're living.
Cause I don't want it no morrrrrre.
No mooooooo-orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre.

Sometimes, things just seem to fall apart.
When you least expect them to.
Sometimes, you want to pack up and leave behind.
All of them and all their smiles.
.
I don't know what to think anymore.
Maybe things will get better.
Maybe things will look brighter.
Maybe, Maybe, Maybe.
.
Sometimes, people surprise you.
And people surprise me.
Well I guess that's the price we pay.
For wanting so badly.
.
I don't know what to think anymore.
Maybe things will get better.
Maybe things will look brighter.
Maybe,., Maybe,., Maybe,.,.
Sometimes, Sometimes, Sometimes.
.
.
When this began,.
I had nothing to say.
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me.
(I was confused).
And I let it all out to find that I'm not the only person with these things in mind (inside of me).
But all the vacancy the words revealed.
Is the only real thing that I got left to feel (nothing to lose).
Just stuck, hollow and alone.
And the fault is my own,.
And the fault is my own.
.
I want to heal, I want to feel,.
What I thought was never real.
I want to let go of the pain I felt so long (erase all the pain 'til it's gone).
I want to heal, I want to feel.
Like I'm close to something real.
I want to find something I've wanted all along.
Somewhere I belong.
.
And I've got nothing to say.
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face (I was confused).
Looking everywhere only to find that it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind (so what am I?).
What do I have but negativity?.
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me (nothing to lose).
Nothing to gain, hollow and alone.
And the fault is my own,.
And the fault is my own.
.
I want to heal, I want to feel,.
What I thought was never real.
I want to let go of the pain I've held so long (erase all the pain 'till it's gone).
I want to heal, I want to feel.
Like I'm close to something real.
I want to find something I've wanted all along.
Somewhere I belong.
.
I will never know myself until I do this on my own.
And I will never feel,.
Anything else until my wounds are healed.
I will never be.
Anything 'til I break away from me.
And I will break away, and find myself today.
.
I want to heal, I want to feel.
What I thought was never real.
I want to let go of the pain I felt so long (erase all the pain til it's gone).
I want to heal, I want to feel,.
Like I'm close to something real.
I want to find something I've wanted all along.
Somewhere I belong.
.
I want to heal I want to feel like I'm,.
Somewhere I belong,.
I want to heal I want to feel like I'm somewhere I belong.
Somewhere I belong.

Watching the wings cut through the clouds.
Watching the raindrops blinking red and white.
Thinking of you back on the ground.
That willful fire burning in your eyes.
I only halfway apologize.
.
And I'll be sorry for now.
That I couldn't be around.
Sometimes things refuse.
To go the way we planned.
Oh I'll be sorry for now.
That I couldn't be around.
There will be a day.
That you will understand.
You will understand.
.
After a while you may forget.
But just in case the memories cross your mind.
You couldn't know this when I left.
Under the fire of your angry eyes.
I never wanted to say goodbye.
.
So I'll be sorry for now.
That I couldn't be around.
Sometimes things refuse.
To go the way we planned.
Oh I'll be sorry for now.
That I couldn't be around.
There will be a day.
That you will understand.
You will understand.
.
Yeah, stop telling 'em to pump the bass up.
Tried to call home but nobody could wait up.
Switch your time zones can't pick the pace up.
I just passed out by the time you wake up.
Best things come to those who wait.
And it's bound to get rough on any road you take.
But don't you ever have a doubt and make no mistake.
I can't wait to come back when I'm going away.
.
So I'll be sorry for now.
That I couldn't be around.
There are things we have to do that we can't stand.
Oh I'll be sorry for now.
That I couldn't be around.
There will be a day that you will understand.
Oh I'll be sorry for now.
That I couldn't be around.
There are things we have to do that we can't stand.
(Things we have to do that we can't stand).
Oh I'll be sorry for now.
That I couldn't be around.
There will be a day that you will understand.
You will understand.
You will understand.
You will understand.
.

[Instrumental].
.
.
Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time.
Hand grenade pins in every line.
Throw 'em up and let something shine.
Going out of my fucking mind.
.
Filthy mouth, no excuse.
Find a new place to hang this noose.
String me up from atop these roofs.
Knot it tight so I won't get loose.
.
Truth is you can stop and stare.
Bled myself out and no one cares.
Dug a trench out, laid down there.
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere.
.
Yeah, someone pour it in.
Make it a dirt dance floor again.
Say your prayers and stomp it out.
When they bring that chorus in.
.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
Just to throw it away.
Just to throw it away.
.
I bleed it out.
Go, stop the show.
Choppy words in a sloppy flow.
Shotgun opera, lock and load.
.
Cock it back and then watch it go.
Mama, help me, I've been cursed.
Death is rolling in every verse.
Candy paint on his brand new hearse.
.
Can't contain him;.
He knows he works.
Fuck this hurts, I won't lie.
Doesn't matter how hard I try.
Half the words don't mean a thing.
.
And I know that I won't be satisfied.
So, why try ignoring him?.
Make it a dirty dance floor again.
Say your prayers and stomp it out.
When they bring that chorus in.
.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
Just to throw it away.
Just to throw it away.
.
I bleed it out.
I've opened up these scars.
I'll make you face this.
I've pulled myself so far.
I'll make you face this now.
.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
Just to throw it away.
Just to throw it away.
.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
I bleed it out.
Digging deeper just to throw it away.
Just to throw it away.
Just to throw it away.
.
I bleed it out.
I bleed it out.
I bleed it out.
.
.
I'm standing in the middle of it.
Middle of it, middle of it.
.
Yo, y'all better wake up; you think we don't see y'all drifting?.
Sleeping on the job and forgetting your position? (position).
Sit straight and listen; what you are missing.
I cook up a batch, hot straight out the kitchen.
No indecision, I spit right.
Heavy as a fist fight.
No gloves and no masks.
No pain and no slack.
No way to look back.
Nobody to say I can't make my own path.
Cause the way that y'all act, I wanna break something.
Comin' at me like the pain I feel means nothing.
Comin' from a place where you can't relate.
Where every word from your face comes across as fake.
And I can hardly take, the way that y'all treat us.
Sending this out to anyone who won't believe us.
Spelling it out so y'all know the deal.
And if you can't feel it, maybe you can't feel.
.
I'm standing in the middle of it.
Middle of it.
Middle of it.
Man, who are you?.
I'm standing in the middle of it.
Middle of it.
Middle of it.
What are you saying?.
I'm standing in the middle of it.
Middle of it.
Middle of it.
What are you writing?.
I'm standing in the middle of it.
Middle of it.
Middle of it.
Man, who are you?.
.
Tell 'em, Motion.
Eat your words.
Say what you used to say and act how you used to act.
Every time you heard my occupation was a rap attack (rap attack).
My conversation's stacked, I switch my defense on you.
Every time you want to get deep you'll see my knuckle package.
Born to die, ferocious emcee make you go back and write your rhymes.
My style chokes up like a little league baseball player.
It moves, I'm strangling as I'm swinging as main mangler.
I wanna dee-four, poach you as your seafood is C4.
I'm gonna rap and you still knee-high.
Y'all wanna train with me, guy?.
Man, it's destructive.
Man, it's like jabs from boxing champ Lennox.
Perfect for your head, I'll fit it like New Era hats.
That top off suits, B-boy etiquette.
Express myself with my hang-side.
Then I extend one finger, the middle to fucking all crouds.
.
I'm standing in the middle of it.
Middle of it.

Man, who are you?.

What are you writin'?.
I'm standing in the middle of it.
Middle of it.
Middle of it.
Man, who are you?.
.
Yo, Motion (yeah?).
Sometimes I feel it's like nothing that I ever do's ever good enough (for real).
Like I should stop and go back to L.A..
Back away where I know I won't be seen.
And nobody's gonna critique the music that I make.
And mistake me for some fucking kid with a backpack.
Rapping on a track just to make a buck.
For a mix-tape that sucks.
And DJ's that don't get it.
But I been down that road and I know.
People don't wanna go where I might go.
Don't wanna know what it's like.
To step outside your zone with a mike.
Just controlling the hype.
And if we need to take shots from them.
And be stopped by them just to meet these ends.
Then so be it, I will not hold my breath.
I'm gonna spit 'til I got none left.
Motion, where you at?.
.
I'm standing in the middle of it.
Middle of it.
Middle of it.
Man, who are you?.
I'm standing in the middle of it.

There's no way to find out what's inside you.
Until you fall into the hole.
You dug for yourself while you slept here.
Too young, too selfish, too cold.
.
And when you find out what's been waiting.
The moment you open your eyes.
You'll see your true reflection.
The very first time in your life.
.
You cannot fight what's in you.
This will not be goodnight.
You cannot fight what's in you.
This will not be goodnight.
.
Cry to yourself.
Nothing will help.
It's to late to change what's been done.
You do what you've always done best.
You run.
.
Into the hole you fall deeper.
Deeper the faster you run.
It won't stop until you accept it.
Accept everything that you've done.
.
You cannot fight what's in you.
This will not be goodnight.

Next message.
Yo, what's up? It's Stef, call me up.
I'm going to be in town all this week.
So, if you want to get that track taken care of, let me know.
Call me on my cell, all right? Late.

Watch as the room rocks men only moon walk.
Mixed media slang, banging in your boom box.
Verbal violence, lyrical stylist.
In a time when rock hip hop rhymes are childish.
.
You can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty.
Rapping to a beat doesn't make you an Emcee.
With your lack of skill and facility you're killing me.
And a DJ in the group just for credibility.
.
I heard that some of you are getting help with your rhymes.
You're not an Emcee if someone else writes your lines.
And rapping over rock doesn't make you a pioneer.
'Cause rock and hip hop have collaborated for years.
.
But now they're getting randomly mixed and matched up.
All after a fast buck and all the tracks suck.
So how does it stack up? None of it's real.
You want to be an emcee you've got to study the skill.
.
Who can rock a rhyme like this?.
Bring it to you every time like this?.
Who can rock a rhyme like this?.
Step, step up, step, step up.
.
So you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity.
But mentally you don't have the hip hop energy.
With a tendency to make up stories.
Sounding like the only hip hop you've heard is top 40.
.
And your record company is completely missing it.
All the kids are dissing it for not being legitimate.
So in a battle you can't hack it, react with whack shit.
And get smacked with verbal back flips.
.
Get your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts.
It's taken decades for emcees to establish this.
You're new to hip hop and welcome if your serious.
But not on the mic leave that to the experienced.
.
Using the waves of sound the true master.
Paralyzes his opponents, leaving him vulnerable to attack.

A reliable audio weapons system.

In space used to carefully attack and neutralize.

Mixed media step up to the microphone.
And you do it like this.
.
.
This is how it's done going for the title and crown.
Where now MC's surround as the beat breaks down.
In 2 elements clobbin' up those that have been blessed.
And as the M-I see the way it ought to be ponessed.
Yes, yes am I the one to keep you on your toes.
Definitely in my b-boy pose, they let your __ like twist.
Touch your chin to your chest to the rhythm like this.
.
Chorus:.
Now see what I have, I want you.
Be with me or Stick n' Move.
Now see what I had, I want you.
Be with me or Stick n' Move.
.
MC's dogging me since the first day I grabbed the mic.
Now it's like Sit, Stay.
Cobra path lifestyles I'm kickin'.
Stickin' MC's real quick 'cause times tickin'.
At the drop of the defense, I let loose the venom.
Sendin', I try to verbal heat up venom.
The ending will come, grab your family and run.
Apocalyptic rhyme pattern taking shots from the sun.
Record in the world, four-thousand-eighty-one.
Question my intentions and your whole world is done.
Like wars to Rome, turn your eyeballs into Saturn.
Full metal jacket fully auto rhyme pattern.

Stick it, rock it for a click and a whicker.
Move it, moving all the tunes and you groove it (4x).

Chorus.

What do I do to ignore what's behind me?.
Do I follow my fate to escape blindly?.
Do I hide my pride away from these bad dreams.
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?.
Do I let it go and try to stand it?.
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?.
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness.
Or do I trust none and live in loneliness?.
Sunlight burns the skin of sleeping men.
I make the right moves but I'm lost within.
I put on my daily facade but then.
I just end up getting hurt again.

I can't hold on.
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin.
It's all too much to take in.
I can't hold on.
To anything watching everything spin.
With thoughts of failure sinking in.
.
If I.
Turn my back I'm defenseless.
And to give into fate seems senseless.
If I hide my pride and let it all go on then they'll.
Take from me till everything is gone.
If I let them go I'll be outdone.
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun.
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer.
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer.

She's got a smile that it seems to me.
Reminds me of childhood memories.
Where everything.
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky.
Now and then when I see her face.
She takes me away to that special place.
And if I stared too long.
I'd probably break down and cry.
Sweet child o' mine.
Sweet love of mine.

Err... that's enough of that shit.

Your blood in mine.
Will be fine.

Keep me down to what you think I should be.

You say I can't understand.
But you're not giving me a chance.
When you leave me, where do you go? (Where do you go?).

All the walls that you keep building.
All this time that I spent chasing.
All the ways that I keep losing you.

The truth is, you turned into someone else.
You keep running like the sky is falling.
I can whisper, I can yell.
But I know, yeah I know, yeah I know.
I'm just talking to myself.

Water gray.
Through the windows, up the stairs.
Chilling rain.
Like an ocean everywhere.
Don't wanna reach for me, do you?.
I mean nothin' to you.
The little things give you away.
And now there will be no mistakin'.
The levees are breakin'.

All you've ever wanted.
Was someone to truly look up to you.
And six feet under water.
I do.

Hope decays.
Generations disappear.
Washed away.

When you feel you're alone.
Cut off from this cruel world.
Your instincts telling you to run.

Listen to your heart.
Those angel voices.
They'll see you to you.
They'll be your guide.
Back home where life leaves us blind.
Love keeps us kind.
It keeps us kind.

When you suffered it all.
And your spirit is breaking.
You're growing desperate from the fight.
Remember your love.
And you always will be.
This melody will always bring.
You right back home.

Love, keeps us kind.
When life leaves us blind.

We knew the world would not be the same.
A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent.
I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita.
Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty.
And to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says.
Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.
I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.

God save us everyone.
Will we burn.
Inside the fires of a thousand suns.

One, it multiplies until you can taste the sun.
And burn by the sky, you try to take it from.
But if it falls, there's no place to run.
Crumbling down, it's (so unreal).
.
They're dealing you in to the term and your end.
And sending you back again to places you've been.
And bending your will until it breaks you within.
And still, they (fill their eyes).

With the twilight, through the skylight.
End the highlights on a frame of steel.
See the brightness of your likeness as I write this.
On a path through (the way I feel).
.
Hear the screaming, am I dreaming, as it's seeming.
That you've played your part.
Like you're heartless, take apart this.
In the darkness, but I know that.
.
I've tried so hard.
And got so far.
But in the end.
It doesn't even matter.
I had to fall.
To lose it all.
But in the end.
It doesn't even matter.
.
I broke down line once there is not what ought to be.
Held back by the battles they fought for me.
Calling me to be part of their property.
And now I see that I (get no chance).
.
I get no breaks, fakes and snakes.
Quickly lead to mistakes.
And now the tightrope within slowly starts to thin.
I could only hope that they (close their eyes).
.
With the twilight, through the skylight.

Today our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate, and deadly, terrorist acts..
.
The jets, fuelled for cross country flights were filled with tens of thousands of gallons of volitile fuel... They were literally flying bombs..
.
OH MY GOD!!.
.
crawling in my skin.
these wounds they will not heal.
fear is how I fall.
confusing what is real.
.
A second airplane! a 727 just rammed into the building!.
.
Oh another one just hit, something else just hit, a very large plane (oh my) just flew directly over my building..
.
there's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface.
consuming/confusing.
.
Make no mistake, the United States will hunt down, and punish those responsible for these cowardly acts..
.
One second after the sound started, there was gray smoke and what looked to be, like confetti flying all over the place....
.
The enormity of the situation today is just ... well it was just incredible..
.
.
this lack of self-control I fear is never ending.
controlling/I can't seem.
to find myself again.
my walls are closing in.
(without a sense of confidence and I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take).
I've felt this way before.
so insecure.
.
In a matter of seconds, the skyscraper collapsed... And was gone..
.
crawling in my skin.
these wounds they will not heal.
fear is how I fall.
confusing what is real.
.
Half of the 400 firefighters that first reached the scene, may be dead..
.
Thousands of lives were suddenly ended by evil, despicable acts of terror..
.
10,000 people in each tower would typically be in there on a normal business day, and we get about another 5,000 visitors during the course of the entire day, so by 8.30 - 9.00 o'clock the building should have been full..
.
Terrorism has been alive and well throughout the rest of the world for a very very long time now, and you can point to as many different places and its come to our shores BIG TIME NOW, we need to understand that..
.
discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me.
distracting/reacting.
against my will I stand beside my own reflection.
it's haunting how I can't seem....

to find myself again.
my walls are closing in.

America was targeted for attack because we are the brightest beacon for freedom, and opportunity in the world, and noone will keep that light from shining. This is one of the darkest days in American history, and it's an on-going nightmare but we will get through this, our freedoms will be intact and the spirit of this country will be stronger than ever..
.
Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot touch the foundation of America. These acts shatter steel, but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve. These acts of mass murder were intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat, but they have failed, our country is strong....

It goes a one, two, three.
.
With the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun.
I don't need to sweat it when the competition come.
Original style, like an eight of eight drum.
So I don't run the track, no, I make the track run.
My momma taught me words, my daddy built rockets.
I hold 'em both together now, tell me what I got.
It's a pretty small weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it.
But learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it.
.
Like that.
.
It ain't over 'cause the sharks on the left side, the snakes on the right.
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite.
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right.
'Cause once they get their teeth in nothing really fights.
And razzle me I do it like I got nothing to lose.
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes.
But steady little soldier, I ain't standing next to you.
I can lay it on the ground before you're even in my view.
Like that.
.
Give me the strength of the rising sun.
Give me the truth of the words unsung.
And when the last bells ring, the poor men sing.
Bring me to kingdom come.
.
This is something for your people on the block to.
Blackout and rock to, give you what you need.
Like Papa, who shot ya.
Seperate the weak from the obsolete.
You're meek, I creep hard on impostors.
And switch styles on the dime, quick-witted y'all.
Quit tripping, I don't have time for your crying.
I grind tough, sucka, make your mind up.
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up?.
Bang, bang, little monkey man playing.
With the big guns only get you slain.
I ain't playing, I'm just saying.
You ain't got a sliver of a chance.
I get ill or I deliver while you quiver in your parents.
So shake, shake down, money, here's the break down.
You can play the bank, I'ma play the bank take down.
And no mistakes now I'm coming to get you.
I'm just a Banksy, you're a Brainwash, get the picture?.
It's like that.
.
We swim against the rising waves.
That crash against the shore.
The body bends until it breaks.
The early morning sings no more.
.
So rest your head.
It's time to sleep.
And dream of what's in store.
The body bends until it breaks.
And sings again no more.
'Cause time has torn the flesh away.
The early morning sings no more.
.
.
A fire needs a space to burn..
A breath to build a glow..
I've heard it said a thousand times,.
But now I know....
.
That you don't know what you've got,.
Oh, you don't know what you've got,.
No, you don't know what you've got,.
Until it's gone....
.
Until it's gone..
Until it's gone!.
.
I thought I kept you safe and sound..
I thought I made you strong..
But something made me realize,.
That I was wrong..
'Cause finding what you've got sometimes means finding it alone..
And I can finally see your light when I let go....
.
'Cause you don't know what you've got,.
Until it's gone..
Until it's gone..
Until it's gone..
.
Until it's gone....
Until it's gone....
Until it's gone....
Until it's gone....
Until it's gone....
.
'Cause you don't know what you've got,.
Oh, you don't know what you've got,.
No, you don't know what you've got,.
It's your battle to be fought!.
No, you don't know what you've got,.
Until it's gone..
.
Until it's gone..
Until it's gone!.
.
.
My insides all turned to ash, so slow.
And blew away as I collapsed, so cold.
.
A black wind took them away from sight.
And now the darkness over day, that night.
And the clouds above move closer.
Looking so dissatisfied.
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing.
.
I used to be my own protection, but not now.
Cause my path has lost direction, somehow.
A black wind took you away from sight.
And now the darkness over day, that night.
.
And the clouds above move closer.
Looking so dissatisfied.
And the ground below grew colder.
As they put you down inside.
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing.
.
So now you're gone, and I was wrong.
I never knew what it was like to be alone.
.
On a Valentine's Day, on a Valentine's Day.
On a Valentine's Day, on a Valentine's Day.
On a Valentine's Day (I used to be my own protection).
On a Valentine's Day (but not now).
On a Valentine's Day ('Cause my mind has lost direction.
On a Valentine's Day (somehow).
On a Valentine's Day (I used to be my own protection.
On a Valentine's Day (but not now).
On a Valentine's Day ('Cause my mind has lost direction.
On a Valentine's Day (somehow).

Forfeit the game.
Stop the talk show.
Product of what.
Your taught to know.
Forfeit the game.
'Cause tomorrow.
When it's all done.
You reap what you sow.
.
You love the way I look at you.
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through.
You take away if I give in.
My life, my pride is broken.
.
You like to think you're never wrong.
(You live what you?ve learned).
You have to act like you're someone.
(You live what you?ve learned).
You want someone to hurt like you.
(You live what you?ve learned).
You want to share what you've been through.
(You live what you?ve learned).
.
You love the things I say I'll do.
The way I'll hurt myself again just to get back at you.
You take away when I give in.
My life, my pride is broken.
.
Chorus.
.
Forfeit the game.
Stop the talk show.
Product of what.
Your taught to know.
Forfeit the game.
'Cause tomorrow.
When it's all done.
You reap what you sow (2x).
.
Chorus (2x).
.
.
No regret for the confidence betrayed.
No more hiding in shadow.
'Cause I won't wait for the debt to be repaid.
Time has come for you.
.
Victimized, victimized, never again victimized.
Victimized, victimized, never again victimized.
.
They're acting like they want a riot, it's a riot I'll give them.
As the sound comes higher on this violent rhythm.
These snakes in the grass, supplying the venom.
I ain't scared of your teeth, I admire what's in 'em.
Keep 'em waiting in the shadows there, thinking they hidden.
But the truth is you don't have the stomach to get 'em.
Go on already hit 'em, yeah you gotta be kiddin'.
Wanna talk about a victim, I'ma put you there with 'em!.
.
Victimized, victimized, never again victimized.
Victimized, victimized, never again victimized.
.
.
This is not the end.
This is not the beginning.
Just a voice like a riot.
Rocking every revision.
But you listen to the tone.
And the violent rhythm.
And though the words sound steady.
Something empty's within 'em.
.
We say "Yeah!".
With fists flying up in the air.
Like we're holding onto something.
That's invisible there.
'Cause we're living at the mercy of.
The pain and the fear.
Until we get, forget it.
Let it all disappear.
.
Waiting for the end to come.
Wishing I had strength to stand.
This is not what I had planned.
It's out of my control.
.
Flying at the speed of light.
Thoughts we're spinning in my head.
So many things were left unsaid.
It's hard to let you go.
.
(Oh) I know what it takes to move on.
I know how it feels to lie.
All I wanna do.
Is trade this life for something new.
Holding on to what I haven't got.
.
Sitting in an empty room.
Trying to forget the past.
This was never meant to last.
I wish it wasn't so.
.
(Oh) I know what it takes to move on.
.
I know how it feels to lie.
All I wanna do.
Is trade this life for something new.
Holding on to what I haven't got.
.
Yeah, yeah.
What was left when that fire was gone?.
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong.
All caught up in the eye of the storm.
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on.
And I don't even know what kind of things I've said.
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead.
So, picking up the pieces, now where to begin?.
The hardest part of ending is starting again!.
.
All I wanna do.
Is trade this life for something new.
Holding on to what I haven't got.
.
This is not the end.
This is not the beginning.
Just a voice like a riot.
Rocking every revision.
But you listen to the tone.
And the violent rhythm.
Though the words sound steady.
Something empty's within 'em.
(Holding on to what I haven't got).
.
We say "Yeah!".
With fists flying up in the air.
Like we're holding onto something.
That's invisible there.
'Cause we're living at the mercy of.
The pain and the fear.
Until we get it, forget it.
Let it all disappear.
(Holding on to what I haven't got!).

There's no peace.
Only war.
Victory decides who's wrong or right.
It will not cease.
Only grow.
You better be prepared to fight.
.
And it will not apologize.
For laying down your life.
.
War.
.
There's no pain.
It will spare.
Fear has become your only right.
And once you're lost.
In your despair.
Forever black eternal night.
.
And it will not apologize.
For laying down your life.
.
War.
Destroyer.
War.
Destroyer.
.
It needs no side to justify.
Laying down your life.
.
War.
Destroyer.
War.
.
.
Landing in the Devil's drop,.
I walked out in the snow..
And climbed up to the mountain top,.
A push from death below..
.
Brother fell protecting us,.
Somewhere far from home..
Lay him down to rest with us,.
In fields of earth and coal..
.
Oh, whoa.
.
Sailing out away from this,.
To ports of foreign shores..
Let us not forget to miss,.
The ones we cannot hold..
.
Oh, whoa.
.
Landing in the Devil's drop,.
I walked out in the snow..
And climbed up to the mountain top,.
A push from death below..
.
Brother fell protecting us,.
Somewhere far from home..
Lay him down to rest with us,.
In fields of earth and coal..
.
.
This is war with no weapons.
Marchin with no steppin'.
Murder with no killin'.
Illin' every direction.
First, no sequel.
Do the math, no equal.
John with no Yoko.
More power, less people.
.
And no, I'm not afraid of that.
Print it in your paperback.
Every rap is made in fact.
To act as a delayed attack.
Every phrase a razor blade.
That's saved until they play it back.
To slay and leave em laying on the pavement.
Bang, fade to black.
.
In the wastelands of today.
When there's nothing left to lose.
And and there's nothing more to take.
But you force yourself to choose.
.
In the wastelands of today.
Where tomorrow disappears.
While the future slips away.
And your hope turns into fear.
In the wastelands of today.
.
Roll credits, you get it.
The show's done.
They're talking for just talking.
But meaning, they got none.
None of 'em come proper.
They talk like a shotgun.
But how many got bred with integrity?.
Not one.
.
So no, I'm not afraid.
To see these suckers hold a blade to me.
Ain't no way to shake the ground.
I built before you came to be.
Take it how you take it.
I'm the opposite of vacancy.
And this is not negotiation.
Y'all can hate and wait and see.
.
In the wastelands of today.
When there's nothing left to lose.
And and there's nothing more to take.
But you force yourself to choose.
.
In the wastelands of today.
When tomorrow disappears.
When the future slips away.
And your hope turns into fear.
In the wastelands of today.
.
In the wastelands of today.
When there's nothing left to lose.
And and there's nothing more to take.
But you force yourself to choose.
.
In the wastelands of today.
When tomorrow disappears.
When the future slips away.
And your hope turns into fear.
In the wastelands of today.
.
.
In this farewell.
There's no blood, there's no alibi.
'Cause I've drawn regret.
From the truth of a thousand lies.
So let mercy come and wash away.
What I've done.
.
I'll face myself to cross out what I've become.
Erase myself.
And let go of what I've done.
.
Put to rest what you thought of me.
While I clean this slate.
With the hands of uncertainty.
So let mercy come and wash away.
What I've done.
.
I'll face myself to cross out what I've become.
Erase myself.
And let go of what I've done.
.
For what I've done.
I start again.
And whatever pain may come.
Today this ends.
I'm forgiving what I've done.
.
I'll face myself to cross out what I've become.
Erase myself.
And let go of what I've done.
.
(Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na).
What I've done.
(Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na).
Forgiving what I've done.
(Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na).
(Na na na na).
.

If everything would just stop.
Then maybe I could clear up my thoughts.
If everything would stand still.
I could've hidden how lost I feel.
.
I should've said what I fear.
I should've let myself fear.
I should've made myself clear.
.
So this is how we fall apart.
This is how the ending starts.
And when we find we lost our minds.
We fake what we don't know.
.
I never asked to let go.
I never thought I could sink so low.
I never let myself down.
Until the second I did right now.
.
I should've said what I fear.
I should've let myself fear.
I should've made myself clear.
.
So this is how we fall apart.
This is how the ending starts.
And when we find we lost our minds.
We fake what we don't know.
.
So this is how we fall apart.
This is how the ending starts.
And when our heads betray our hearts.
We fake what we don't know.
.
Cause all we are is everything we've done.
All we are is how quickly we run.
And all we are.
We are.
.
This is how we fall apart.
But this is how beginnings start.
Cause when our heads betray our hearts.
We fake what we don't know.
.
And if our doubt begins again.
The answers find us in the end.
So in the meantime we'll pretend.
And fake what we don't know.
.
This is how we fall apart.
But this is how beginnings start.
Cause when our heads betray our hearts.
We fake what we don't know.
.
And if our doubt begins again.
The answers find us in the end.
So in the meantime we'll pretend.
And fake what we don't know.
.
.
Yeah,.
I am not a pattern to be followed.
The pill that I'm on.
Is a tough one to swallow.
I'm not a criminal.
Not a role model.
Not a born leader.
I'm a tough act to follow.
.
I am not the fortunate and the fame.
Or the same verse I'm telling you to forfeit the game.
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain.
And I found out the underbelly is sicker than it seems.
And it seems ugly, but it can get worse.
'Cause even the blueprint is a gift and a curse.
'Cause once you have the theory of how the thing works.
Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first.
.
And I'm not a robot.
I'm not a monkey.
I will not dance even if the beat's funky.
Opposite of lazy, far from a punk ya'll.
Stop talking, start tryna catch up mother fucker.
.
And all the people say.
Aah, aah, aah.
.
Tryin' to catch up mother fucker.
.
Aah, aah, aah.
.
Lauren said money changes situations.
Big said it increases the complication.
Kane said don't stab, I ain't the one.
Chuck said that an Uzi weigh a mother fucking ton.
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me.
Rocking every stage and every place that they brought me.
I'm awfully underrated.
But can be corrected.
.
And so this second I'm gonna save it for the record.
I am the opposite of whack.
Opposite of weak.
Opposite of slack.
Standing in the heat.
Standing in a crack.
Closest to a beat, far from a punk.
Ya'll outta stop talking, start tryna catch up mother fucker.
And all the people say.
Aah, aah, aah.
.
Trying to catch up mother fucker.
.
Aah, aah, aah.
.
Oh when they come for me.
Come for me.
I'll be gone.
.
Oh when they come for me.
Come for me.
I'll be gone.
.
Oh when they come for me.
Come for me.
I'll be gone.
.
And all the people say.
Aah, aah, aah.
.
Trying to catch up mother fucker.
.
Aah, aah, aah.
.
And all the people say.
Aah, aah, aah.
.
Trying to catch up mother fucker.
.
Aah, aah, aah.
Aah, aah, aah.
Aah, aah, aah.
.

You've been faking it all this time, you left my trust on the firing line..
As the promises break, the only mistakes - Giving you what was mine..
Your words are clear but their meanings gone..
The notes are right but the tunings wrong..
And when you tell me again that I should give in,.
I can only take it so long, long, long, long....
.
A%#!.
You're terrified, terrified..
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away,.
You're terrified, terrified..
You'd rather throw it all away!.
.
Fear is dancing inside your lies exposing secrets that you've disguised..
And I'm biting my tongue as you become victim of a compromise..
Cause I know who you really are, not a scratch where you pretend you're scarred..
And it's time that you seek the truth without me..
I can only get you so far, far, far, far....
.
A%#!.
You're terrified, terrified..
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away,.
You're terrified, terrified..
You'd rather throw it all away..
.
Throw it all away, all away, all away..
.
A%#!.
You're terrified, terrified..
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away,.
You're terrified, terrified..
You're terrified, terrified..
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away,.
You're terrified, terrified..
You'd rather throw it all away, all away, all away,.
You're terrified, terrified..
You'd rather throw it all away!.

I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight.
Because my conscience leaves me no other choice.
A true revolution of values will lay hands on the world order and say of war.
This way of settling difference is, is not just.
This business of burning human beings with napalm.
Filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows.
Of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into veins of peoples normally humane.
.
Of sending men home from the dark and bloody battlefields.
Physically handicapped and psychologically deranged.
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love.
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love.
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love.
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love.
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love.
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love.

I woke up in a dream today.
To the cold of the static, and put my cold feet on the floor.
Forgot all about yesterday.
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore.
A little taste of hypocrisy.
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react.
Even though you're so close to me.
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back.
.
It's true.
The way I feel.
Was promised by your face.
The sound of your voice.
Painted on my memories.
Even if you're not with me.
.
I'm with you.
You now I see.
Keeping everything inside (with you).
You now I see.
Even when I close my eyes.
.
I hit you and you hit me back.
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still.
Fine line between this and that.
When things go wrong I pretend that the past isn't real.
Now I'm trapped in this memory.
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react.
So, even though you're close to me.
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back.
.
It's true.
The way I feel.
Was promised by your face.
The sound of your voice.
Painted on my memories.

.
I'm with you.
You now I see.
Keeping everything inside (with you).
You now I see.
Even when I close my eyes.
.
No, no matter how far we've come.
I can't wait to see tomorrow.
No matter how far we've come.
I can't wait to see tomorrow.
With you.
.
You now I see.
Keeping everything inside (with you).
You now I see.
Even when I close my eyes.

With you.
You now I see.
Keeping everything inside (with you).

There's a time, when the operation of the machine becomes so odious.
Makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part.
You can't even passively take part.
And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels.
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus.
And you've got to make it stop.
.
To save face, how low can you go?.
Talk a lotta game, but yet you don't know.
Static on the wind, makes us all say whoa.
The people up top push the people down low.
Get down, and obey every word.
Steady, get in line if you haven't yet heard.
Wanna take what I got, don't be absurd.
Don't fight the power, nobody gets hurt.
If you haven't heard yet, then I'm lettin' you know.
There ain't shit we don't run when the guns unload.
And no one make a move, unless my people say so.
Got everything outta control, now everybody go.
.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
.
Feel alone, final blow.
We, the animals, take control.
Hear us now, clear and tall.
Wretches and kings, we come for you.
.
So keep face, how slow can you go?.
Talk a lotta shit, and yet you don't know.
Fire on the wind, makes you all say whoa.
The people up top and the people down low.
Get down, and I'm runnin' it like that.
The front of the attack is exactly where I'm at.
Somewhere in between the kick and the hi-hat.
The pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact.
So get with the combat, I'm lettin' them know.
There ain't shit you can say to make me back down, no.
So push the button, let the whole thing blow.
Spinning everything outta control, now everybody go.
.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
.
Feel alone, final blow.
We, the animals, take control.
Hear us now, clear and tall.
Wretches and kings, we come for you.
Still alone, fight our blow.
Filthy animals beat down low.
Steel and bone, black and blue.
Run at the sunshine, we come for you.
.
From the front to the back and to side to side.
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high.
Front to the back and the side to side.
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high.
Front to the back and the side to side.
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high.
Front to the back and the side to side.
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high.
Front to the back and the side to side.
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high.
Front to the back and the side to side.
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high.
.
When the operation of the machine becomes so odious.

You can't even passively take part.
And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels.
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop.
And you've got to indicate to the people, run in to the people on it.
And unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

(No).
I won't let you control my fate while I'm holding the weight of the world on my conscience.
(No).
I won't just sit here and wait while you weighin' your options.
Your makin' a fool of me.
(No).
You didn't dare to try and say you don't care.
And solemnly swear not to follow me there.
(No).
It ain't like me to beg on my knees.
Or, please oh baby please.
that's not how I'm doin' things.
(No).
No I'm not upset, no I'm not angry.
I know love is love and love sometimes, it doesn't pay me.
(No).
I'm never without you, I'll always be with you.
You'll never forget me, I'm keeping you with me.
(No).
I won't let you take me to the end of my row.
Or keep burning and torching my soul.
(No).
No I'm not your puppet.
And no, no, no, I won't let you go.
.
No, no matter how far we've come.
I can't wait to see tomorrow.
No matter how far we've come.
I, I can't wait to see tomorrow.

With you.
(You, now I see, keeping everything inside).
With you.
(You, now I see, even when I close my eyes).

I'm about to....
wasn't that fun, lets try something else.
Forty five caliber killa but outta the filla.
Dela villa gonna show y'all brothers how you not a gorilla.
.
Smooth talking fully automatic weapon concilla.
Taste thriller, break thriller, lets hit em' with the bounce filla.
Filthy stinkin' standin' on solid ground.
Still be sinkin' submerging and the parks.
Still be Linkin' pluck beef when its starts, fuck what your thinking, its not a mirage.
.
I'm in a mother fuckin' tractor from out of the garage.
With an if through the duck, but its hard to dodge.
In the back of that spine where my dogs' lie.
Gonna flip it straight up rippin' apart ya squad.
.
X to the excutioner style, cuts and blends.
Like a syringe hangin' you from each of ya limbs.
See me comin' through ya party hard.
Without no bodyguard.
.
Smoking something stompin on each of ya Tims.
I'm the be	 to the L the A the see king.
And when it come to planning the thought to keep thinking man.

Shut up.

Everything seemed so picture-perfect when it all started.
I should of known that you were so cold-hearted.
All the lies, it just seemed so fake.
And yet you seemed so blissful when we parted.
You were just a fake!.
It's just the principle.
You always seemed to think you were invincible.
Invisible to all my pain and anguish that you caused.
my life just seemed to paused.
I thought it was the end!.
Reflecting on all the insults you delt.
I can't express all the pain I felt.
Eating me up on the inside.
I couldn't find no place, no sanctuary for me to hide,.
When I needed you the most, you just pushed me aside.
You only cared about yourself!.
You tried to ruin me!.
You were just a fake.
You tried to get everthing for free!.
You only cared about yourself.
