It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh uh uh uh
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers uh uh uh uh
Yeah
We're happy free confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines, it's time uh oh

I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright, if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright, if we just keep dancing like we're 22, 22

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded, too many cool kids uh uh, uh uh
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming instead of sleeping
Yeah
We're happy free confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical oh yeah
Tonight's the night, when we forget about the heartbreaks, it's time uh oh

I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22 uh uh ah ah ah 22 uh uh uh

I don't know about you, 22 uh uh 22 uh uh

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news I gotta have you, I gotta have you ohh, uh, yeah

I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22 uh uh, 22 uh uoh,

22 uh uh, yeah, 22 uh uhoo, yeah yeah

It feels like one of those nights uh uh
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights uh uh
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights uh uh
You look like bad news I gotta have you, I gotta have you


Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart

Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say I still can't believe
That you would walk away
It don't make sense to me but

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart

It's not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart


I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road
I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one, who feels
The way I do

I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know,
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl
Trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need?
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's okay

I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know,
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl
Trying to find a place in this world

Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly

I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know
Oh, I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know
Oh, I'm just a girl
Trying to find a place in this world

Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl, oh, oh
Oh, I'm just a girl


The way you look, the way you laugh the way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry the way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me.

Once I thought that love was something that I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough!

The way you look, the way you laugh the way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry the way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me.

Woah, oh, oh, oh...

In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Boy you got everything.

The way you look, the way you laugh the way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry the way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me.

I love your attitude, all your tattoos, your every thought
Your smile. your lips, and boy the list goes on and on and on!

(The way you look, the way you laugh) the way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry the way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me.

The way you look, the way you laugh the way you love with all you have
Your dance, your drive, you make me feel alive
Now I think you see there ain't nothing about you
That don't do something for me.


I wake up, I stretch out
I wonder what you're doing right now
Yeah, I slept in my makeup again
Tell myself I must be crazy,
Thinking about him

I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel out of my hair
About that time, you call me
And I'm reminded, without you I'd be

[Chorus]
A stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for her love to find her
Lonely like a harbor line
Thats never seen a boat
Just like a line in an old love letter
No one wrote

I go to work, work all day
I'm a walking tape recorder of everything you say
Walk to my car, dig out my keys
Start thinking if you were with anyone but me

[Chorus]
A stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for her love to find her
Lonely like a harbor line
That's never seen a boat
Just like a line in an old love letter
No one wrote

There you are, on the street
Standing there all waiting on me
Yeah, I show you, my new shoes
You say you love em, and baby without you,
I'd be

[Chorus]
A stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for her love to find her
Lonely like a harbor line
Thats never seen a boat
Just like a line in an old love letter
No one wrote

I wake up, I stretch out
Wonder what you're doing right now


I walked through the door with you, the air was cold,
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house,
And you still got it in your drawer even now.

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze.
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate.
The Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,
And I can picture it after all these days.

And I know it's long gone,
And that magic's not here no more,
And I might be okay,
But I'm not fine at all.

'Cause there we are again on that little town street.
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me.
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well.

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red.
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-size bed
And your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team
You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me.

And I know it's long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night.
We dance around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah.

Maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much,
And maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up.
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well.

Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise.
So casually cruel in the name of being honest.
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well.

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it, 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well


(Hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey)
People like you always want back the love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
The more I think about it now the less I know
All I know is that you drove us off the road

Stay, hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye

Stay, hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay (Stay, stay, stay)

Let me remind you this was what you wanted (Oh oh oh)
You ended it
You were all I wanted (Oh oh oh)
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this
Oh, all you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy (All you had to do was stay)
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay (Oh)
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay (Ooh)

Sometimes I wonder 
How it's going to feel 
Will my first love be true and real?
Will I be ready when 
My heart starts to fall?
What will I do when my love comes to call? 

And my daddy tells me 
That I light up his world 
Every day he says, "Darling 
You're my best girl" 
He tried to teach me 
From the very start 
The meaning of love 
So nobody breaks my heart 

Will my love come in a bowl of fire? 
Will it be filled with hope and desire? 
Will my love come in the pouring rain? 
Am I ready for the joy? 
Am I ready for the pain? 
Am I ready for the boy? 
Am I ready for love? 
For love 

I know I'm not a little 
Girl anymore 
Because I'm feeling things 
I've never felt before 
Sweet sensations 
And anticipations 
Calling commotion 
To my emotions 

And I hear the words 
My daddy says to me 
He said, "Be true to yourself 
And keep your spirit free 
And love will find you 

One way or another 
Be good to yourself 
And be good to each other" 

Will my love come in a bowl of fire? 
Will it be filled with hope and desire? 
Will my love come in the pouring rain? 
Am I ready for the joy? 
Am I ready for the pain? 
Am I ready for the joy? 
Am I ready for the pain? 
Am I ready for love? 

It's a run around the world 
And it's moving so fast 
Though I want to find 
A love that's going to last 
A love so strong 
That it can withstand 
The weight of the world 
In the palm of its hand 

Will my love come in a bowl of fire? 
Will it be filled with hope and desire? 
Will my love come in the pouring rain? 
Am I ready for the joy? 
Am I ready for the pain? 
Am I ready for the joy? 
Am I ready for the pain? 
Am I ready for this game? 
Am I ready for the kiss? 
Am I ready for the stars? 
Am I ready for the bliss? 
Am I ready for love?


American boy, living life as it goes
Sitting on the fence posts
Living in the light
American boy, living in the real world
Trying just to get the girl
Trying to survive

The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill Avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy

Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
Looking for the love
Suddenly rise, an American beauty
Suddenly he cheats, sent from above

The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill Avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The dream of an American boy

American boy, raising little babies
Hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you
Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn
That's grown up, American boy

The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Grandview Avenue
Mama makes her cookies, and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy


Well she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldnt help thinking that there
Was a little more to life
Somewhere else
After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
Yeah, and if she had to die
Trying she had one little promise
She was going to keep

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy, baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

It was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
She could see the cars roll by
Out on 441
Like waves crashing in the beach
And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful
Something that's so close
And still so far out of reach

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy, baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl


I like the way you wanted me
Every night for so long baby
I like the way you needed me
Every time things got rocky

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken do you mean
Do you mean what you say
When you say our love could last forever

(Chorus)
But I'd rather you be mean than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

I like the way you'd hold me
Every night for so long baby
I like the way you'd sing to me
Every time things got rocky


I was believing in you
Was I mistaken do you say
Do you say what you mean
When you say our love could last forever

(Chorus)
Cause I'd rather you be mean than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

(Bridge)
You would run around and lead me on forever
While I stay at home still thinking we're together
I wanted our love to last forever

(Chorus)
But I'd rather you be mean than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow
Baby don't you break my heart slow


I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier then ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I'd loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time all the time


'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood

(Hey!) Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood

(Hey!) Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shining now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak baby I couldn't breathe
I rubbed it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood

(Hey!) Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood

(Hey!) Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
Now did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't
So if you come in my way, just don't
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood

(Hey!) Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood

(Hey!) Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts (Ghosts)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (Hey!)
You say sorry just for show (Hey!)
You live like that, you live with ghosts (Hey!)
Hm, if you love like that blood runs bad

'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood

(Hey!) Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them (Think we can solve them)
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood

('Cause now we got bad blood) 'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done (Look at what you've done)
'Cause baby now we got bad blood (Woah)
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood (Hey!)


You turn your dial to 93.7
Broadway acts like he's 11
Self-proclaimed
Say's he's the worst mistake ever to land in Michigan
I'm just a singer of country songs
Just trying to play guitar and not do no wrong
But if you listen to just one thing I say

You should turn Z93 on
Broadway's Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called Tim McGraw
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothing like when you're on
The Electric Barnyard

Daisy's from a trailer park in St. Louis
Growing up not wearing any shoes
Prettiest hillbilly girl you'll see all day
Growing up the other trailer park girls
Couldn't hide their jealousy
Because she had the only phone for miles
Now she uses it as a DJ

So you should turn Z93 on
Broadway's Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called Tim McGraw
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothing like when you're on


Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into my eyes
And sometimes 
I think of you late at night, I don't know why
I wanna be somewhere where you are
I wanna be where

You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

I wake up, I'm alive
In only a little while, I'll cry
'Cause you're my lullaby
So baby come hold me tight 'cause I-I
I wanna be everything you need
I wanna be where

You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

Just as long as you're mine
I'll be your everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh baby let me miss you, let me see your
Dream about, dream about
Dream about your eyes!
Eyes, eyes, beautiful eyes


Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do

Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl
Who had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies that your family watches
Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that
And for the first time what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months

Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again


All is quiet in the world tonight
Counting stars and fireflies
This summer sings a lullaby
Of just me and my baby

On the hood of his daddy's car
Pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
Just me and my baby

The world is spinning 'round
'Cause of just what I found

Ooh life's so sweet right here
Ooh keeping it young and crazy
Ooh just want to stay right here
'Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

Driving home by the riverside
Wishing I could slow down time
Faking pictures in my mind
Of me and my baby

The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
The back-road was a better way
For me and my baby

The closer that we get
Ooh I can't leave yet

Ooh life's so sweet right here
Ooh keeping it young and crazy
Ooh just want to stay right here
'Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

Both know what we found
So we turned that car around

Ooh life's so sweet right here
Ooh keeping it young and crazy
Ooh just want to stay right here
Ooh and be with my baby
Ooh yeah
And be with my baby


Her hair is Harlowe gold
Her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold
She's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll turn her music on you
You won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow
She got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo stand off sighs
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll let you take her home
It whets her appetite
She'll lay you on her throne
She got Bette Davis eyes
She'll take a tumble on you
Roll you like you were dice
Until you come out blue
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll expose you, when she snows you
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please ya
She's precocious, and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll tease you
She'll unease you
Just to please ya
She's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll expose you, when she snows you
She knows ya
She's got Bette Davis eyes


You live down the street, in a broken down house
And a car up on the blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
That we won't forget this Sunday

It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this, our first kiss

All my friends are saying
Girl what are you thinking?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another,
Girl that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't wanna come down
But they make it so tough

'Cause everyone we know is trying to push us apart,
Putting doubt in our hearts,
And they get what they want, 'cause you're gone

All my friends are saying,
Girl why are you crying?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

You come to my door in the pouring rain
We know what we don't have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
'We don't have to do things their way'

All my friends are saying,
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better


Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And, I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say sabotage
I never saw it coming, nor would I have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling
And, she thinks I'm psycho
'Cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but
Sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school
So it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but I'll always get the last word
Whoa

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

And do you still feel like you know what you're doing,
'Cause I don't think you do, oh
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
C'mon show me how much better you are
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say sabotage


Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, want to play?
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors, lie
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king baby I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storm
I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name


I see your face in my mind as I drive away,
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people,
And sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie,
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,
Now I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple,
Never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,

And I can't,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
People are people,
And sometimes it doesn't work out,
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

And we know it's never simple,
Never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,

And I can't,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to

It's two am
Feelin' like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy,
Easy for me

It's two am
Feelin' like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy,
Easy for me

And we know it's never simple,
Never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me

I can't,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to

Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to

Sorry (oh) sorry
Sorry sorry
Sorry sorry


Here you are now
Fresh from your war
Back from the edge of time
And all that you were
Stripped to the bone
I thought you' d want to know

That when you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

Lay down your guns
Too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart
Broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you won't go again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

I'm so glad to see you smiling
So good to hear your laugh
I think that you've found you even
Missed yourself
I'm only asking this because I think that
Truth be told
Oh, you'll never go again
Again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
Breathless
So when you feel the world is crashing down
I want you come run into my arms


Emily comes home from school
Grabs onto her daddy's hand
He says, "Baby girl, what's wrong with you?"
She says, "Please don't make me go back there again."

She said, "I wish there was someway to make them stop it."
So he drives down to that principles office
And says, "I didn't bring her up so they could cut her down
I didn't bring her here so they could shut her out
I'd live my whole damn life to see that little girl smile
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
She wasn't brought up that way."

Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh but something's different this time
She doesn't have too much to say
She said, "He tried but there's just some things I won't do"
And through the tears she said, "I couldn't do that to you"

And he said, "I didn't bring you up so he could wear you down
Take that innocent heart and turn it inside out
I'd live my whole damn life to see my little girl smile
So don't let nobody take that away
You weren't brought up that way."

The phone rings on a rainy night
Says, "It's Officer Tate"
He said, "Sir, there's been an accident
You'd better come down here right away
A drunken driver missed an overpass
And Emily she's fading fast."

He says, "God I didn't bring her up to watch them lay her  down
Nearly killed me the day they put her mama in the ground
Only thing that kept me alive was that little girls smile
So please don't take that away
It won't be easy taking her today, she wasn't brought up that way."

He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyes


I had to catch my breath when I saw you there 
Across the room holding her hand
I'd never guessed starting over would be so good on you 
But here I am still believing there might come a day
We'll pick up where we left off...

By the way your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way my heart's still breaking
It's going to take me awhile to love again
So many things that I forgot to say, by the way.

I should've let you know all the ways you made me feel alive
Guess it's too late
So I'll just get my coat and make my way into this breezy night
Give you one last wave
Maybe you'll drop what you're doing come over here and say 
"I'm looking good."

But by the way your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way my heart's still breaking
It's going to take me awhile to love again
So many things that I forgot to say.

By the way you still look amazing
And I must've been crazy to let you get away
By the way, if you ever wonder
I still have the same old number just in case.
I still miss you, and I still love you, by the way.
By the way...




Any day now
They're talking war
I can see the light
That's in your eyes
They're not talking
A week or two
Oh, daddy
Can I go with you?
Oh, daddy
Can I go with you?

You pack a suitcase
And take a picture
From the wall
I always knew
This time would come
When I ask how long
You think
You're going to be
You say
"Eh, this crazy world's
Come undone"

Summer's over
And leaves begin
To fall
And another winter's
On the way
I knew
I wasn't going to take
This very well
But I'd give everything
To have you here today

Every day now
They're talking war
I know
This time has been
Like it's never
Been before
We're not talking
About a week or two
Oh, daddy
Can I go with you?
Oh, daddy
Can I go with you?
Oh, daddy


And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
It's a revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah

So we've been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger
But we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes
Says we can beat this

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
It's a revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah

Tonight we'll stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah


What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing
Would the song still survive without five golden rings
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe
What would happen if God never let it snow
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie
Tell me what would you find

You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

What if angels did not pay attention to
All the things that we wished they would always do
What if happiness came in a cardboard box
Then I think there is something we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away
Tell me what would you find

You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships
Hundred mile an hour lives
And it's this time of year
And everybody's here
It seems the last thing on your mind

Is that the day holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
But here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more

There's gotta be more
There's gotta be more


Please take down the mistletoe
'Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
'Cause everything I want is miles away
Snow covered little town
My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
Season's greetings, hope you're well
Well I'm doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
And everybody's here, except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold

But for me it's just a lonely time
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

Merry Christmas everybody
That'll have to be something I just say this year
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

You were mine


The drought was the very worst, ah ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months, and months of back and forth, ah ah
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
Hung my head, as I lost the war, and the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do, ah ah
When the butterflies turned to dust, they covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof, ah ah
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
I think I am finally clean, ah
Said, I think I am finally clean, ah

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older I won't give in
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst, ah ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
Finally clean, think I'm finally clean, ah ah
Think I'm finally clean


I drive around this town in a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well that's good enough for me

Don't need the real thing
That's just another thing for me to try to tame
Don't know if I could
It might just break me

I thought that for a little while
Every sunset I'd be a riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me

Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough, running free
That's the closest to a cowboy
You'll see me

Before I met him
I was so sane and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window

I learned the dirt roads
And I got my heart broken
'Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go

I thought that for a little while
Every sunset I'd be riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me

Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough, running free
That's the closest to a cowboy
You'll see me

It was all a bit wonderful and strange
But I'll never look at a sunset the same like,

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me

Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough, running free

Sitting fishing by the river bank
Swimming in the water tank
That's the closest you'll see me

Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough, running free
That's the closest to a cowboy
You'll see me


You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel somethin'
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up the walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you, and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing, honey
But I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you
Died for you

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Oh, every smile you fake is so condescending
Countin' all the scars you've made
Now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you


You said it in a simple way,
4 AM, the second day,
How strange that I don't know you at all.
Stumbled through the long goodbye,
One last kiss, then catch your flight,
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself don't get attached,
But in my mind I play it back,
Spinning faster than the plane that took you,

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.

The delicate beginning rush,
The feeling you can know so much,
Without knowing anything at all.
And now that I can put this down,
If I had known what I know now,
I never would have played so nonchalant.

Taxi cabs and busy streets,
That never bring you back to me,
I can't help but wish you took me with you,

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.
I guess you're in London today,
And I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.

This is falling in love in the cruelest way,
This is falling for you and you are worlds away.

New York, be here.
But you're in London and I break down,
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.

This is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
And I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.

I don't wanna miss you like this.
Come back, be here.
Come back, be here.


I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore and I 
know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore

Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far and I
I've got you down
I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start

Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name oh
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I've watched you so long, screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say

But I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore


I've never gone with the wind, just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants
'Til you opened the door, there's so much more
I've never seen it before
I was trying to fly but I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier crazier crazier

I watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes and you made me believe.

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier,crazier,crazier oh

Baby you showed me what livin' is for
I don't wanna hide anymore

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I'm, I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Crazier, crazier


He said, I got me a nice new apartment
In a city, wouldn't you have hated that?
I'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with.
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back,

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

He was lying when he said he moved to L.A.
He's just hiding out on the other side of town
With his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away
He's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying,

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

She almost called him on the night that he wrote
These simple words on his goodbye note

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

In dark blue Tennessee


Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps,
Praying the floor won't fall through, again
My mother accused me of losing my mind,
But I swore I was fine, you paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game,
But you changed the rules every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone
Tonight, well I stopped picking up, and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home, I should've known

Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said "run as fast as you can"

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home

Dear John, I see it all, now it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen is too young
To be played by your dark twisted games, when I loved you so?
I should've known

You are an expert at sorry,
And keeping the lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry
Have tired, lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me,
So don't look now, I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home.

I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known, you should've known
Don't you think I was too young? You should've known


I'm a laid back
T-shirt, blue jean, mood ring
Kinda girl
Hey yeah what's the word on you
Lay low I'm a mission rebel
Angel devil
Little lamb upper mental
Sometimes I get temperamental

But here I am an open book
Turn the page it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

I'm poetry, complicated
Simply stated
Hey yeah baby how about you
I was born free
I'm a cell phone hippie
Are you with me?
When I mess up I don't get up
I just get down yeah

But here I am an open book
Turn the page it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

It's raining on Sunday
There's nothing on TV
Yesterday was lonely
You're the only one who gets me
My mind is like an island
Drifting through the ocean
I can't stop thinking about you
I bet you're thinking of me too

Well here I am an open book
Turn the page it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me
Yeah here I am an open book
Turn the page it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me


She walks to school with her arms crossed
It's just another day-at ten o'clock she hears this screaming
Then finally she sees them
It's scary how things change.

And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried!

Didn't she call you? 
Didn't she need you bad enough?
Was there some reason, another way up?
Did you not write it down, just one more thing to do?
Where were you, didn't she pray too?

He kissed his wife goodbye and took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night to put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle, three men walked and said:
"We're here to die for our God,"
He stood up and said:
"That's funny because my God died for me!"

I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried!

Didn't he call you?
Didn't he need you bad enough?
Was there some reason, another way up?
Did you not write it down, just one more thing to do?
Where were you and didn't he pray too?

The taxis pulled up on the very day of
They road a hundred floors up just to come back down
They never thought they'd see the day the tower's up in flames
There was nothing left to say when it all came down.

And didn't they call you?
Didn't they need you bad enough?
Was there some reason, another way up?
Did you not write it down, just one more thing to do?
Where were you, where were you?
And didn't they pray too? Oh. 

I walk to school and I wear a cross
I'm counting every day.


My mama stood across the room
Face to face but never eye to eye
Recalling words we said
The battle that we swore
We'd never fight

Breaking pieces off with every lie
A tear came to her eye
And she said

Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you block me out tonight
Honey where are you?
And don't hate me for loving you

He walked around my life
And made blind
With every single move
He caught me staring at him
Mad about him

Little that I knew
Love is different
When you play the fool
And all I wanna do is say

Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you make cry tonight
Like you always do
And don't hate me for loving you

I slammed the door
Sat on the floor
Cried into my bed
Said are you there?
Do you even care?
To cross above my head
But someone said

Don't turn away now
And don't rip my heart out
Things are meant to happen like this
I know it's right for you
And don't hate me for loving you

I looked up at the sky
Face to face and finally
Eye to eye


I know you guys have a lot of amazing bands
From this part of the world, did you know that?

Well now he's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in his hair, ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
He walks like summer and talks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to cha ay ange
Ay ay ange
But since his return from the stay on the moon
He listens like spring and he talks like June, ay ay 
Ay Ay 

But tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
That heaven is overrated, tell me
Did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar and did you miss me while you were 
Looking for yourself out there 

Well now he's back from that soul vacation
Chasing his way through the constellation, ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, ay ay ay
Ay ay ay

Well now he's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that he might think of me as 
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man 
Who is too afraid to fly so he never did land 

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance 
Along in the light of day yeah
Head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find and did you miss me while you were 
Looking for yourself out there 

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong can you imagine 
No first dance, freeze dried romance 
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte you have ever had and me

Just tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance 
Along in the light of day yeah
Head back toward the Milky Way
And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar and did you miss me while you were 
Looking for yourself?

Nana nana nana 
Nana nana nana na-ah
Oh oh oh

Nana nana nana 
Nana nana nana na-ah
Oh oh oh

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong can you imagine 
No first dance, freeze dried romance 
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had and me

Thank you so much


There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered "have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks, like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
Two a.m., who do you love?
I wonder till I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, hey
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was, enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that this was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again
These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you


All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago is green eyes and freckles
And your smile in the back of my mind making me feel like
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall painted blue
But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down and open up the door for you

And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies the beautiful kind
Making up for lost time, taking flight, making me feel like

I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you, know you, know you

All I know is we said hello
Your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
All I know is he held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

All I know is we said hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed


Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open

The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score

Keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around), oh they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown) and nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just gotta keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes

Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open (keep your eyes open)

(Keep your ey-eyes open)
(Keep your ey-eyes open)
(Keep your ey-eyes open)

Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping

Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open


Isn't it funny how many times we can say
We drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page
And moved on
That's what we thought

But here I am in the same old car
Having myself another same old brown-eyed bar
Uh oh, uh oh

I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road until the one we're on ends
And we'll tell each other things like "I need you"

You and me
Baby, this is what we do
I may see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
Fall back on you

You always let someone come in between
You're talking around the truth and never say what we mean
Look at all this wasted time

I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friend
We'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end
And we'll tell each other things like "I love you"

You and me
Baby, this is what we do
I may see
There are people who you come back to
So fall back on me, 
Fall back on you

Maybe we'll last
Maybe we won't
Maybe we'll stop talking or talk like girls
But just, baby, get along with me

You and me
Baby, this is what we do
I may see
There are people that you come back to
Fall back on me
Baby, I'll fall back on you
Fall back on me baby,
Baby, I'll fall back on you
Fall back on you

Fall back on you


You say you've turned it off
Hid your heart up on a shelf
Scared of what it might cost
To take it off for someone else
Because loving him, you lost
Too much of yourself
Baby, can't you see that she's not me and . . .

I need you to know you can fall into me
That my arms are wide open
And will always be
Right here waiting, staying strong
Come and fall into me

I'll follow any road anywhere to get to you
I'll open up my soul
If that's what you need me to do
But now, baby, it's your move
All you've got to do
Is believe in love, just believe in us now

I need you to know you can fall into me
That my arms are wide open
And will always be
Right here waiting, staying strong
Come and fall into me

Just believe in love
Just believe in us
Baby . . .

I need you to know you can fall into me
That my arms are wide open
And will always be
Right here waiting, staying strong
Come and fall into me

Come and fall into me
Baby, fall into me


There's somethin' bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah

We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent mindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

So baby drive slow
Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it remember it

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Well you stood there with me in the doorway
my hands shake
I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something, it's fearless.

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless


You take a deep breath
And you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in awhile
Try and stay out of everybody's way

It's your freshman year
And you're gonna be here for the next four years
In this town
Hoping one of those senior boys
Will wink at you and say, "you know I haven't seen you around, before"

'Cause when you're fifteen,
Somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen

Feeling like there's nothing to figure out

Count to ten
Take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
At fifteen

You sit in class next to a red-head named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls
Who they think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon as we can

And then you're on your very first date
And he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And you're mama's waiting up
And you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing around the room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen,
Somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen

And your first kiss makes your head spin around

But in your life you'll do things
Greater than dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted
Was to be wanted
Wish you could go back
And tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen,
Somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen

Don't forget to look before you fall

I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

La la la la la
Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl
And take a deep breath as you walk through the doors


Someone struck a match against the night
All I could see was you and I, I was captivated 
A perfect little dream inside my head
And then reality crept in and erased it.
For a while I thought that I could hold you 
But you were just a temporary high.

Firefly, you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it do you?
I wish I could keep you, firefly, firefly.

Something so beautiful and free
Was as never meant to be caged in
I thought I had you in my hand, I tried to catch you
But I can't chase the wind
And every time I reach out to touch you
I remind myself you were meant to fly.

Firefly, you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it do you?
I wish I could keep you, firefly, firefly.

I'd like to think I'd be all that you wanted
But not even that is enough...

Firefly, you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it do you?
I wish I could keep you, I wish I could keep you firefly, firefly.


Once upon a time, I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me

Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened? Please tell me

'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure

So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence, that cuts me to the core
Where is this going? Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

Oh back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always

And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby,
You said forever and always, yeah.

I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days 
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything 
And everybody believed in you


CHORUS:
It's alright just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent


But some things you can't speak of 
But tonight you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now 
If only you had seen what you know now then
Wasn't it easier in your firefly catching days
When everything out of reach someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild till you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you


CHORUS:
It's alright just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh 
Who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent


It's okay life is a tough crowd
32 and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent


BRIDGE:
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new


CHORUS:
It's alright just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent


It's okay life is a tough crowd
32 and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent


Lost your balance on a tightrope
It's never too late to get it back


Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that.

I don't even know her,
But I feel a responsibility,
To do what's upstanding and right,
It's kinda like a code, yeah,
And you've been getting closer and closer,
And crossing so many lines.

And it would be a fine proposition,
If I was a stupid girl,
But honey I am no-one's exception,
This I have previously learned.

So don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Ah ah, don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
I see you turn off your phone,
And now you got me alone,
And I say, don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

I just wanna make sure,
You understand perfectly,
You're the kind of man who makes me sad,
While she waits up,
You chase down the newest thing,
And take for granted what you have.

And it would be a fine proposition,
If I was a stupid girl,
And yeah I might go with it,
If I hadn't once been just like her.

Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Ah ah, don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
I see you turn off your phone,
And now you've got me alone,
And I say, don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

Call a cab,
Lose my number,
You're about to lose your girl,
Call a cab,
Lose my number,
Let's consider this lesson learned.

Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Ah ah, don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Wanna see you pick up your phone,
And tell her you're coming home,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

It would be a fine proposition,
If I hadn't once been just like her.


My name's Gracie
I'll be five in May
Kinda scared 'cause
I've never been on a plane

My mama says that it'll be alright
'Cause I'm gunna see my daddy tonight
And she says that

There's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
An' I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

My name's Heather
Guess we're on the same flight
Don't mind Gracie
She could talk to you all night

She's finally well enough to travel
Doctor says she's in the clear
She's been in and out of hospital
Since the beginning of the year

And there's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
But none of us want to get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

James T. Johnson
That's her daddy's name
He's been overseas
It'll be a year today

He never talked about being scared over the phone
He just said me and Gracie will come and take him home

There's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

And the people that we meet
As we go through the rain
There are no accidents in what we do


You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and its all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And its comin' over you like its all a big mistake

Holding my breath, won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong, you're all I wanted
Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time I'm wishin' he was you instead
Oh, oh, holding my breath, won't see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong, you're all I wanted
Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

I know, I know, I just know
You're not gone, you can't be gone
No

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong, won't finish what you started
Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it


Here you come again
Just when I've begun
To get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart
Around your little finger
Here you come again
Just when I'm about
To make it work without you

You look into my eyes
And light those dreamy eyes
And pretty soon I'm wondering
How I came to doubt you
All you got to do
Is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you
And in a little while
You're messing up my mind
And filling up my senses

Here you come again
Looking better than a body
Has a right to
And shaking me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again

All you got to do
Is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you
And in a little while
You're messing up my mind
And filling up my senses

Here you come again
Looking better than a body
Has a right to
And shaking me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again
Here I go
And here you come again


Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we would talk
And I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can't help myself

Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I've got some things to say to you
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I've never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving
I think you and I should stay the same

Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can't help myself

They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine

Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else

I can't help myself if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can't help myself
myself
Mm
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Oh, Oh,
Mm
Mm


I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York Time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light "Go"
Yeah, you skipped the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

And darling, it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of 'I need you'
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

Cause darling, it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you

It was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you


I think of you every single evening 
As I lay awake at night
I try to think; try to walk away with you
And I say:

Honey baby, don't do anything crazy around us
Say that everything will be fine
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I want to make you mine?
Because everybody else in the world is driving me crazy 
Except you, honey baby
Oh!

Flying high, I can see his smiling 
As we walk down by the drives
Take my hand, take my breath away
Because you make me feel like flying

Honey baby, don't do anything crazy around us
Say that everything will be fine
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I want to make you mine?
Because everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby
Oh!

Oh, you are everything I'll ever need
Oh, you are everything I want to be
Drive me crazy, have me, baby
All I really want to say is:

Honey baby, don't do anything crazy around us
Say that everything will be fine
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I want to make you mine?
Because everybody else in the world is driving me crazy 
Oh, except you, honey baby


Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know
There's just no getting over you
Hello, I'm just a fool 
Who's willing to sit around and wait for you
But baby, can't you see
There's nothing else for me to do 
I'm hopelessly devoted to you
But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside 
I'm not in my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

My head is saying, "Fool, forget him"
My heart is saying, "Don't let go"
Hold on to the end, that's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you
But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside 
I'm not in my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you


(Oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh)

Stand there like a ghost
Shaking come the rain, rain
She'll open up the door
And say, are you insane, -ane?

Say it's been a long six months (Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want (Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl

And then you say
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait for ever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait for ever and ever

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl

Remind her how it used to be, be
Yeah, with pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tell her how you must've lost your mind (Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
When you left her all alone and never told her why, why (Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)

And that's how it works
That's how you lost the girl

And now you say
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait for ever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait for ever and ever

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, yeah

And you could know, oh
That I don't want you to go

Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me, yeah, yeah

And then you say I want you for worse or for better (Worse or for better)
I would wait for ever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait for ever and ever (I want you for ever and ever)

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
(That's how it works) And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh (Get the girl)

(It's how it works) And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh

And that's how it works
That's how you got the girl


I bet this time of night you're still up.
I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply.
I bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say "Hello" to you
And risk another goodbye.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe.
It's probably better off this way.
And I confess babe,
In my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I wanna try again with you.
And I almost do.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me, not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

I bet this time of night you're still up.
I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me.


Been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls, hoping you'd call
It's just a cruel existence like there's no point hoping at all

Baby, baby, I feel crazy, up all night, all night and every day
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
What is happening to me?

I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

I'm sitting eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life, oh

Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
I gave you something, but you gave me nothing
What is happening to me?

I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit (fit, babe) wherever (wherever)
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
I see you around in all these empty faces
Up all night, all night and every day
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
Now I'm in a cab, I tell 'em where your place is
What is happening to me?

I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
Until you come back home


Wish I had concentrated,
They said love was complicated,
But it's something I just fell into.
And it was overrated,
But just look what I created,
I came out alive, but I'm black and blue.
Before you ask me if I'm alright,
Think about what I,
Had to do, yeah

Wake up and smell the break up,
Fix my heart, put on my make-up,
Another mess I didn't plan.
And I'll bet you thought you beat me,
Wish you could only see,
I got an "I Heart question mark"
Written on the back of my hand!

I'd be fine if you'd just walked by,
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right.
But I can't believe you made me,
Sit at home and cry like a baby,
Wait right by the phone every night.
And now you ask about you and I,
There's no you and I,
Remember what you put me through,
I had to

Wake up and smell the break up,
Fix my heart, put on my make-up,
Another mess I didn't plan.
And I'll bet you thought you beat me,
Wish you could only see
I got an "I Heart question mark"
Written on the back of my hand!

And when you're home all alone at night,
You'll still wonder why
You took everything I had, oh baby.
I haven't thought about you and I,
There's no you and I, and I know
Someday you will

Wake up and smell the break up,
Realize that we won't make up,
It didn't go the way you planned.
And you'll know you didn't beat me
When you look down and see
I got an "I Heart question mark"
Written on the back of my hand!

Written on the back of my hand!
An "I Heart question mark", yeah.
Written on the back of my hand!


Once upon time
A few mistakes ago
I was in your sights
You got me alone
You found me
You found me
You found me

I guess you didn't care
And I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard
You took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies
He'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning

And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt
Is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see
He was long gone
When he met me
And I realize the joke is on me

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

When your saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything
Yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble


I I I I, I I I I
I I I I, I I I I
I I I I, I I I I, I I

You stand with a hand on my waist line (I I I I, I I I I)
Good to see that we're out in blank side (I I I I, I I I I)
I can hear them whisper as we pass by (I I I I, I I I I)
It's a bad sign, bad sign (I I)
Something happens when everybody finds out (I I I I, I I I I)
See the vulture circling in dark cloud (I I I I, I I I I)
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out (I I I I, I I I I)
It could burn out (I I)
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes (I I I I, I I I I)
And guns, they are the hunters, we are the foxes (I I I I, I I I I)
And we run

Baby I know places we won't be found and they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places
I know places

Lights flash on the run for the fences (I I I I, I I I I)
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it (I I I I, I I I I)
Lose sleep, swing ship, all the damn time, not this time (I I I I, I I I I, I I)
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it (I I I I, I I I I)
My love, they are the hunters, we are the foxes (I I I I, I I I I, I I)
And we run

Baby I know places we won't be found and they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love

Baby I know places we won't be found and they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places

(I) They take their shots, we're bulletproof
I know places
(I) And you know for me it's always you
I know places
(I) In the dead of night, you act so great
I know places
(I) And I know for you it's always me
I know places

(I I I I, I I I I)
(I I I I, I I I I)


Ooh baby give me one more chance
(Show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me [back in your heart]
Ooh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms
(I want you back)
I want you back(x4)
Ooh baby
I want you back
(x2)
Ooh
Oh baby give me one more chance
(Show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me [back in your heart]
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms
I want you back
(x2)
Ooh baby


It's 2 A.M. in your car
Windows down, I pass my street
The memories start

You say it's in the past
And drive straight ahead
You think I'm gonna hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live

And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

It's 2 A.M. in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you

We were a crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live

And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore

And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I

You always knew how to push my buttons (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
You give me everything and nothing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
This mad, mad love makes you come rushing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
Stay back where you stood (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)

I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)

2 A.M., here we are
See your face
Hear my voice in the dark

We were a crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live

And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live

And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore

And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
You give me everything and nothing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
This mad, mad love makes you come rushing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
Stand back where you stood (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)

I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would

I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I (I wish you would)


Throwing pennies at the fountain
But when you're standing on the mountain
It's kind of hard to aim
Like the tree we cut our names in
There must be an explanation
Guess it didn't get enough rain
I need reasons why you're leaving

Well I guess I wished on a plane, I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on the paper wasn't really in your heart
Because I swore when you said that you loved me
Guess I heard you wrong

And I guess I wished on a plane, and I thought it was a star


I don't think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes

He'd never fall in love
He swears, as he runs his fingers through his hair
I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
That I know all his favorite songs

And I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful
He has his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him..
I'd lie

He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn't a light go on
Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long

He sees everything in black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine

I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful
He has his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him..
I'd lie

He stands there, then walks away
My God, if I could only say
I'm holding every breath for you

He'd never tell you, but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up is
My God, he's beautiful
So I put on my make-up and pray for a miracle

Yes I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Oh, and it kills me
His sister's beautiful
He has his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him..
If you ask me if I love him..
I'd lie


I'm every women, it's all in me 
Anything you want done, baby I'll do it naturally
I'm every women, it's all in me  
I can read your thoughts right now, every one from A to Z
Oh, oh, oh.

I can cast a spell with secrets you can't tell
Mix a special brew, but fire inside of you
But anytime you feel danger or fear
Instantly I will appear 'cause

I'm every women, it's all in me 
Anything you want done, baby I'll do it naturally
I'm every women, it's all in me  
I can read your thoughts right now, every one from A to Z
Oh, oh, oh.

I can sense your needs like rain onto the seeds
I can make a rhyme of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down to good old fashion love
I've got it, I've got it, I've got it yeah-ah-ah!

I'm every women, it's all in me 
Anything you want done, baby I'll do it naturally
I'm every women, it's all in me  
I can read your thoughts right now, every one from A to Z.

I'm every women, it's all in me 
Anything you want done, baby I'll do it naturally
(Anything you want)
I'm every women, it's all in me  
I can read your thoughts right now, every one from A to Z.

(I'm every women, it's all in me...)


Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
Sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side

And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

Just a small-town boy and girl
Living in the crazy world
Trying to figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do

And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
And only you can tell

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you


Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them,
Now I'm pacing up the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to a night when you said to me,
"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose"

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

If you're out there
If you're somewhere
If you're moving on
I'll be waiting for you
Wary, since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door
And I say

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you say it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby, I don't like the ending
Oh, I thought you'd be here now, whoa
Thought you'd be here by now


I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything?
And everybody believed in you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you'll live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
And everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep?
Before the monsters caught up to you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent

It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty two and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too

Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to
Be brand new

It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent

It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty two and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Lost your balance on a tight rope, oh
It's never too late to get it back


She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by
And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me but if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me but if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

Like shadows in a faded light
Oh we're invisible
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize

I just want to show you, she don't even know you,
Baby let me love you, let me want you".

She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile


(Spoken):
We can step it up just a little bit of a notch. We can step it up I think. And I want you to sing along to every song that I sing that you know, please. As loud as you possibly can, I will not get offended. I think one of the cool things about being able to play guitar is that you can play whatever you want. And uh, you can play songs that you wrote or you can play songs that other people wrote or you can play country songs or you can play, you can play this.

To the left
To the left
Everything you own 
In the box to the left
In the closet
That's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it
Please don't touch

Keep talking and yes that's fine
Could you walk and talk 
At the same time and
It's my name thats on the tag
Come in with your bags
Let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard
Telling me how I'm such a fool
How I'm never going to find a man 
Like you
Got me twisted

You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you
In a minute
Matter of fact
He'll be here in a minute 
Baby
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you
Ever for a second get to thinking

You're irreplaceable

So
Go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick
And see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought
That I didn't know
What'd you think 
I was putting you out for
Because you were untrue
Hauling her around in the truck
That I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standing in the front yard
Telling me how I'm such a fool
Talking about
How I'll never find a man like you
Got me twisted

You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter of fact
He'll be here in a minute
Baby
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second
Get to thinking
You're irreplacable
Yeah


I like the way you sound in the morning,
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound I have ever heard

I like the way I can't keep my focus,
I watch you talk you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is we should be together

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa oh I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me

Baby, I'm never gonna leave you,
Say that you wanna be with me too
Cuz I'ma stay through it all so jump then fall

Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me I love each freckle on your face, oh,
I've never been so wrapped up,
Honey, I like the way you're everything I've ever wanted

I had time to think it all over and all I can say is come closer,
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa oh I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me

Baby, I'm never gonna leave you,
Say that you wanna be with me too
I'ma stay through it all so jump then fall

The bottoms gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees,
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

Whoa oh I need you baby
Don't be afraid please
Jump then fall, jump then fall into me

Baby, I'm never gonna leave you,
Say that you wanna be with me too
I'ma stay through it all so jump then fall

Jump then fall baby
Jump then fall into me, into me

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine
And every time you're here baby, I'll show you, I'll show you
You can jump then fall, jump then fall, jump then fall 
Into me, into me yeah


She didn't have a reason to go, oh no
She didn't have a reason to stay
Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run

And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow

If I could drive all night 
Would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
An unfamiliar exit sign
If I just drive on by
Just south of knowing why

I didn't really know her that well 
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind. 
She felt so out of touch, just felt too much
If you don't know what you want, nothing's ever enough

And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound
That's where I'm headed right now

If I could drive all night 
Would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
An unfamiliar exit sign
If I just drive on by 
Just south of knowing why

I don't have a plan
I don't have a map
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
I don't have a when
And I don't have a where
I don't even know if I'm knowing I'm there

And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow

But If I could drive all night 
Would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
An unfamiliar exit sign
If I just drive on by
Just south of knowing why

I just drive on by
Drive on
Drive on
Drive all night

If I drive on
Drive on
Drive on
Drive all night
Just south of knowing why


Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kiss me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year
Maybe this year I'll give it to someone special

'Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special


I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go
Away
Away

I do recall now
The smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July ninth
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you missed
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember
The swing in your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake
Meetin' my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is that
I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is that
I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last


One daybreak, one heartache, every once upon a time
That black dress, happiness, bubble baths and quarter lines
They mean so much to everyone 
But you count them up one by one
Clear midnights and his father, was thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
A blue body afraid of it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
They're for the little things

Oil paintings and make it, every detail turned out bad
One night stands, new romance, living for that love and person
It means so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one
Clear midnights and his father, was thinking that your dad was ten feet tall

A blue body afraid of it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
They're for the little things, oh, yeah 

No fighting, black riding, wish upon a star and give the moon a smile
Pretending, defending, take a risk and go a thought for the right
Strawberries and fairies with wings
They're for the little things
Na na na, na na na, na na na na, uh yeah
Na na na, na na na, na na na na, oh yeah


I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "this is absurd"
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, "long live the look on your face"
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered


I've got a lying smile, I never put out for you
'Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
And they say little girls have big dreams
And nothing in the word was gonna come between me and you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out
Love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing, it'd be a long time going

They say it's better to have lost, than never to have loved at all
And I say whoever said that didn't have too far to fall
And they say little girls are so naive 
That wasn't how it was supposed to be, with me and you

And it was a long time coming,
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out
Love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing, it'd be a long time going

I burned my bridges, had sleepless nights
Washed my sins on the neon lights
And I'm still not over you

And it was a long time coming,
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out,
Love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing, it'd be a long time going
A long time going
And it would be a long time, long time going
It would be a long time, long time going


We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello

Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, please, don't go

And I said,
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby just say yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me, I was begging you, please, don't go

And I said Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes

Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby just say "Yes"

Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said
"Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby just say yes"

Oh, oh,
Oh, oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you.


There's a little girl in this little town 
With a little too much heart to go around 
Live forever, never say never 
You can do better, that's what she says 

Her mama named her Lucky on a starlit night 
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite of
The fact that she's different and yet she's the same 
And she says do do do do do do do do do do do do do do 
do do do do do do do do 
Lucky you, lucky you 
Do do do do do do do do 

She sings her little song
She walks a long a little 
Pathway headed for the skies 
Left her travels, lives they unravel 
Mind over matter, that's what she says 

Her mama named her Lucky on a starlit night 
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite of
And the fact that she's different and yet she's the same 
And she says do do do do do do do do do do do do 
do do do do do do do do do do do 
Lucky you, lucky you, lucky you 
do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do 

Maybe she'll sing you do do do do
Maybe she'll bring you up to the skies 
Honey, she'll love you 
Funny how some view 
Angels above you ain't so far away. 

Her mama named her Lucky on a starlit night 
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite of 
The fact that she's different and yet she's the same 
And she says do do do do do do do do do do do do 
do do do do do do do do do do 
Lucky you, lucky you


Your feet under the table
I love it when they're touching mine
Your hands make the cat's cradle
To tell me everything is fine
All I see is you looking at me

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and made up you

You smile just like a picture
It doesn't even need a frame
Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my name
And all I want is just what I've got

Do you know when you go 
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and made up you

I'd never let you go
Even If I could
Because I never could've dreamed you up this good

Oh, oh

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and made up you

Made up you
Oh, oh
Made up you


He's got a nice little life
He's gonna live it, but on
Friday nights he plays that mandolin
Painted red, and he said
It's not the best I know
But it's mine, I'm gonna make it mine

People there can't help but care
About the friendly music of a guy
Who's getting by from their applause
He's got a song that moves along
He's got his local crowd tonight
At Angelina's family bar and grill

He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin

Got a car, got a scar
Like everyone he's got a few but
Everybody loves that mandolin
Got his problems, bills to pay
Somehow that boy finds a way
Through paychecks in tip jars, yeah

He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin

Oh he's the kind of guy
Who never really wanted fame
His feet are planted firmly on the ground
He never wanted people to remember his name
He never wanted word to get around
That he found heaven on earth

He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin
Oh, I'm the guy who plays the mandolin
Mandolin
Oh, mandolin


She said
"I was seven, and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights."
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and fallin' in love
And our mamas smiled, and rolled their eyes
And said, "Oh, my, my, my"

Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up; you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me, and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh, my, my, my, my

Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined, like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled, and rolled their eyes
And said, "Oh, my, my, my"

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two AM, ridin' in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
Slammin' of doors 'stead of kissin' goodnight
You stayed outside till the morning light
Oh, my, my, my, my

A few years had gone and come around
We were sittin' at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came, and our mamas cried
You said, "I do," and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on the very front porch
After all this time, you and I

And I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine in the sky
Oh, my, my, my


I shined your shoes
I poured the wine
I gave you all of my time

I patched your fake smile
Against your friends
Which apparently is a crime

I gave you space
You took my place
And gave it to her

But life's too long 
To waste it all loving a liar

And when love hands me matches now
I'm going to burn it down

I keyed her car
Got my guitar
And wrote this damn song

Look what you've found
She's been around
I hear the line's long

And don't you tell me 
To be nice
I'm not a nice girl

She died from complications
Of the things you told her

So when love hands me matches now
I'm going to burn it down

Ain't it funny
You said honey
You meant sitting duck
Well I say cheater, liar, truck on fire, loser, leaver, deceiver
Just a few I've thought of

And when love hands me matches now
Going to burn it down
I'm going to burn it down
Oh yeah
Going to burn it, burn it, burn it down

Matches, now


You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You, have knocked me off my feet again,
Got me feeling like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails
On a chalk board, calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

You can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down,
Try to block you out 'cause I never impress you
I just want to feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold but the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening, washed up and ranting
About the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean and a liar and pathetic
And alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Yeah someday I'll be big enough
So you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so (mean)
Someday I'll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean)

And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean)
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?


Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of fallin'
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sittin', there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Flash forward, and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

And we got bills to pay
We got nothin' figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

Do you remember, we were sittin' there, by the water?
You put your arm around me, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Oh, oh, oh, oh

And I remember that fight, two-thirty a.m.
'Cause everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye,
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone"

You said, "I remember how we felt, sitting by the water.
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time.
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter.
She is the best thing that's ever been mine."

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Do you believe it?
We're gonna make it now
And I can see it

(I can see it now)


(Spoken):
Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Hilton. Um, I met him a couple months ago doing a show out in California, um, and I had met him because he had said some nice things about me in a magazine and said, "You know, I'm a really big fan of Taylor Swift's music," and I read that and I'm like, wow, that's really cool. So I had my management contact his management and he arranged to come be at one of my shows. And so, you know, I asked him to come out and sing with me. And while he was standing there next to me on stage I said, "Tyler, how would you like to be in one of my music videos?" And uh, the crowd, he was kind of silent but the crowd was like, "Yeah! Oh my God!" You guys know how to do that? That's what I like to hear. Anyways, so he's standing here on stage and I'm like straight up, "Do you want to be in a music video? I'm shooting one in a couple weeks." And, uh, he goes, "Well, I guess. Yeah sure." Because I mean the crowd was going so loud that if he would have said no they would have probably booed him off the stage. Which was kind of my point of asking him on stage. So basically I forced him to be in my music video. Have ya'll seen that one? Would ya'll like me to bring him out and do a song with him? Tyler Hilton's in the house tonight! So, uh, the song I asked to sing with him, um, a couple months ago when we had a show together was one that he sings on One Tree Hill. You see, Tyler is on the show One Tree Hill because he's cool. He was also in the movie Walk The Line, he played Elvis Presley. So I decided to go all out for my hometown. So, uh, Tyler, you going to sing a song with me?

Yeah, let's do it! If you guys know, sing along too.

Taylor:
Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
I'm still standing here
And you're miles away
And I wonder why you left me
And there's a storm that's raging 
Through my frozen heart tonight

Tyler:
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spent my time just thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild
But it's my heart that's begging 
Down this long distance line tonight

Both:
And I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what I might say

Tyler:
There's a message in the wires
And I am sending you a signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
But it's my heart that's breaking down 
This long dusty road of mine

Both:
But I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I aint missing you at all
No matter what my friends say

Taylor:
And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to you or something
I can't bridge this distance
Honey, stop this heartache all alone

Both:
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friends say
I ain't missing you
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
Yeah, no matter what your friends say

Hey yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No

(Spoken):
Good night everybody! Woo! You like that, girls?


I like glitter and sparkly dresses
But I'm not gonna talk about that
In my monologue

I like baking and things that smell like winter
But I'm not gonna talk about that
In my monologue

La La La
La La La

I like writing songs about douchebags who cheat on me
But I'm not gonna say that
In my monologue

I like writing their names in songs so they're ashamed to go in public
But I'm not gonna say that
In my monologue

La La
La La La La La 

This is my musical monologue

You might think I'd bring up Joe
That guy who broke up with me on the phone
But I'm not gonna mention him
In my monologue

Hey Joe, I'm doin' real well
Tonight I'm hosting SNL
But I'm not gonna brag about that
In my monologue

La La La
Ha Ha Ha
Ha Ha Ha
Ha Ha Ha
La La La

And if you're wondering if I might
Be dating the werewolf from Twilight

I'm not gonna comment on that
In my monologue

La La
La La La La La

This is my musical monologue

You might be expecting me to say
Something bad about Kanye
And how he ran up on the stage
And ruined my VMA monologue

But there's nothing more to say
'Cause everything's okay
I've got security lining the stage

This is my SNL monologue

La la
La la la la la

This is my SNL monologue

La la
La la la la la

That was my SNL monologue


I know we've got a lot to say 
Between now and forever
But I'd be a game if you would play, 
And I dare this to get better

So all throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do, is follow you

And if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

Wherever you think I am tonight
Just know we're miles from a heartbreak
Because in the blink of one pretty brown eye
I'll be right where you are baby

Sometime along the way 
You took my breath away
Distracted by the view
I fall right into you

And if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

They say I need to see all the people out there waiting
But you take one look at me
And I know the mistake I'd be making

'Cause if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need my love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

I know we've got a lot to say 
Between now and forever


On a childhood highway through a night alone 
I was barely breathing, I was crawling home 
Well, it's not quite London or the south of France 
Or an Asian island or a second chance 

Going back to Nashville, thinking about the whole thing 
Guess you got to run sometimes 
Maybe I'm a fast train rolling down the mountain 
Watching all my life go by 

You're a distant memory, you're an exit sign 
I was talking crazy on the driver's side 
And I know I hurt you but I won't confess 
Was that blood or a wine stain on your wedding dress? 

Going back to Nashville, thinking about the whole thing 
Guess you gotta run sometimes 
Maybe I'm a fast train rolling down the mountain 
Watching all my life go by 

Going back to Nashville, laughing at a bad break 
What's the use in wondering why? 
Maybe I'm a storm front rolling through the valley 
Tearing up a good July 

And it's safe and warm where nothing ever happens 
Would it be so hard to realign a star or two? 
Change a southern night for you 
Well, it's not quite evening, and it's not New York 

There's a scar in the blue sky by the old airport 
And I'm talking crazy on the driver's side 
I will always love you like a long goodbye


I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

I need you now
Words I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came

My world's a little colder now
But I'm keeping warm somehow

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need, don't need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you?
I don't need you, don't need you now

I need you now
Words I heard you whisper to me
We were walking down a one-way street

You need me now
That's what you've been telling my friends
But I've come too far to go back there again

My heart, my mind and number have changed
You might as well forget my name

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you?
I don't need you, don't need you now

I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And I waited so frustrated
So who's gonna hold you?
I don't need you now

And I don't know where you are
I don't wonder where you are
I don't dream about you  
'cause I don't need you now

I don't dream about the way
That I never heard you say
'I need you, I need you'
I don't need you now

Don't need you
Don't need you now


Your little hands wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in and turn on your favorite nightlight

To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have honey
If you could stay like that

Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
No one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
Never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out
Someday and call your own shots

But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your p.j.s getting ready for school

Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
And no one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up
Oh I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
Could still be little
Oh I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple

Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please try to never grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just never grow up


Look at you
Look at me
Look at who
We could be

I wanna know
Who you are
What you want
From the start

And everytime I look at you
I can hardly say a thing
my head starts to spin
And it hits me then
I love you

And everytime you look at me 
I could go crazy but I don't 
say it but I won't
Cause I'd rather be alone 
Than lose you

And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, nevermind

All the time
Everyday
There's nothing I can do baby
To make it go away

So look at you
And look at me
Now think of who
We could be

And everytime I look at you 
I can hardly say a thing
my head starts to spin
And it hits me then
I love you

And everytime you look at me I could go crazy 
but I don't say it but I won't
Cause I'd rather be alone 
Than lose you

And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, nevermind

All I really wanna say is I need you babe
But how could you understand
What happens if you turn away
And everything turns blue and grey
And I just wish I told you, nevermind

And I could tell you now
But baby nevermind

Yeah
Oh yeah

I could tell you now but nevermind

Yeah 
Oh yeah yeah

And I could tell you now but nevermind


We're all bored
We're all so tired of everything
We wait for
Trains that just aren't coming
We show off
Our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We're so young
But we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb
But we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears
Of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
So get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

We're all here
the lights and boys are blinding
We hang back
It's all in the timing
It's poker
He can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace

We need love
But all we want is danger
We team up
Then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors
Are terrible and cruel
But, honey most of them are true

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come on, come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded, it's so romantic (it's so romantic)

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free


It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes down to my skin
Driving away and I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
There's nothing to say and I
I try to grab at the fray 'cause I, I still love you but I can't!

Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye baby
I want you back but it has come down to nothing
All you have is to walk away from
The one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah.

Picture frame is empty it's black and white
You're smiling down at me
I take your photo off the dash
Back to the conversation we were so sure of everything
Everything we thought we'd always have.
Lost in the sound of it, the here and the now comes and
It seems like I'm becoming part of your past!

Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye baby
I want you back but it has come down to nothing
All you have is to walk away from
The one thing I thought would never leave me.

There's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And I can feel you like you're slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends.

Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye baby
I want you back but it has come down to nothing
All you have is to walk away from
The one thing I thought would never leave me.

Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye baby
I want you back but it has come down to nothing
All you have is to walk away from
The one thing I thought would never leave me
Yeah, if there was one thing I knew would never leave me...

It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes down to my skin.


He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating intoxicating
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you


Oh
We were standing in an empty room
The moonlight was fallin'
You were holdin' my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I coulda spent a life with you
But those days are over
You were callin my name 
When your face faded from view

Wasn't it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day
Wasn't it you that told me?

Angels fly, in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimmin" out on the lake?
Stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night

Oh
I remember waking up with you
The days doin' nothin'
You meant more to me then, than you ever knew
You were gonna be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a nobel seminar
Hope the the world never tore that out of you

Wasn't it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day
Wasn't it you that told me?

Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimmin' out on the lake?
And stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises you made on Our last night?

Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved?
And the songs we played and the indian days
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
Like harold and martin singing

I was waving as you drove away
The sunlight was falling
You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane

Angels fly in the air tonight
Was it just like the promises that we made?
And stars collide in the air so light
Was it just like those promises that you made?
On our last night
On our last night 
Oh,oh,oh,whoa,whoa,yeaah, oh 


I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he said,

Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said,

Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is a slamming screen door
Sneaking out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone, and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late, and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again, oh yeah, oh, oh, yeah

I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song


Elevator buttons and morning air,
Strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs,
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares,
But right now,
My time is theirs.

Seems like there's always
Someone who disapproves,
They'll judge it like they know about me and you,
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do,
The jury's out,
And my choice is you.

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
And life makes love look hard,
The stakes are high,
The waters rough,
But this love is ours,

You never know what people have up their sleeves,
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me,
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles,
But I don't care,
'Cause right now you're mine,
And you say,

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
And life makes love look hard,
The stakes are high,
The water's rough,
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate,
If it's wrong and,
Your hands are tough but they are where,
My belong in,
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you.

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth,
And I love the riddles that you speak,
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored,
'Cause my heart is yours.

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
And life makes love look hard,

And don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
But they can't take what's ours,
They can't take what's ours,
The stakes are high,
The water's rough,
But this love is ours.


Looking at it now
it all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good.

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods

Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)
Ooh your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (we decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good.

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods?

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying baby, I did too
But when the sun came up I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out, I said, I'm setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up you were looking at me

You were looking at me
Oh!
You were looking at me

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods? (I remember)
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (Oh, I remember)

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?

If you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough

I'd like to keep you until I'm old
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, perfect have I loved

Do you remember the stupid things we used to do?
Before September stole me away from you
The time we got your truck stuck in the creek
Because baby, roads weren't wild enough for you and me

Saying:
If you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you until I'm old 
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, perfect have I loved

I used to see you by the bridge we used to cross
I found the feeling of trying to get lost
You would smile that smile that I tried so hard to forget

It's hard to douse a fire that I still haven't put out yet 

And if you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you until I'm old
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, perfect have I loved

Love was all we knew
And faith was growing on the vines
Words were all we had
And for one summer you were mine

Saying:
If you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe, this will be enough
I'd like to keep you until I'm old 
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, perfect have I loved


I know he loved you
A long time ago
I ain't jealous of you
Just thought you should know
You were never good enough for him or anything like me
So you might as well sit back 'cause I ain't tryin to show maturity

CHORUS
X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were makin
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart 
In permanent marker

So I found that picture
Of you in that green dress
Sure had a good time
Cleanin up that mess
He found 30 other pieces but he'll never find 'em all
Tried to tape them back together 
Now he knows to keep it off the wall

CHORUS
X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were makin
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart 
In permanent marker

Well I don't appreciate you callin him to reminisce
The only reason is you're seein just how much better off he is

CHORUS
X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were makin
Who do you think you are
To Write on his heart

CHORUS
X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were makin
Who do you think you are
To Write on his heart
In permanent marker
In permanent marker
Oh 
Permanent marker


State the obvious
I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine!
I'll tell mine
You're gay
By the way

I hate that
Stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burn

There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here
Planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

'Cause I hate that
Stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burn

If you're missing me
You'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health

'Cause I hate that
Stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive

You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying

So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard

I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burn

Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
Just another picture to burn
Baby, burn


Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh red
Burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
Burning red
Burning it was red

Oh losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah red
We're burning red

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street


Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And, I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say sabotage
I never saw it coming, nor would I have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling
And, she thinks I'm psycho
'Cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but
Sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school
So it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but I'll always get the last word
Whoa

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

And do you still feel like you know what you're doing,
'Cause I don't think you do, oh
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
C'mon show me how much better you are
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say sabotage


Elevator buttons and morning air,
Strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs,
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares,
But right now, 
My time is theirs.

Seems like there's always
Someone who disapproves,
They'll judge it like they know about me and you,
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do,
The jury's out,
And my choice is you.

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
And life makes love look hard,
The stakes are high,
The waters rough,
But this love is ours,

You never know what people have up their sleeves,
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me,
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles,
But I don't care,
'Cause right now you're mine,
And you say,

So don't you worry your pretty little mind, 
People throw rocks at things that shine,
And life makes love look hard,
The stakes are high,
The water's rough,
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate,
If it's wrong and,
Your hands are tough but they are where,
My belong in,
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you.

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth,
And I love the riddles that you speak,
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored,
'Cause my heart is yours.

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
And life makes love look hard,

And don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
But they can't take what's ours,
They can't take what's ours,
The stakes are high,
The water's rough,
But this love is ours.


I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong
I got a lump in my throat because you're gonna sing the words wrong


I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor
Plastic dinosaurs, I love you to the moon and back

I remember your blue eyes looking into mine like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand
Little man, from even that moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember the drive home when the blind hope
Turned to crying and screaming, "Why?"
Flowers piled up in the worst way
No one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here

I remember the last day when I kissed your face
I whispered in your ear

Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
Out of this curtained room in this hospital
We'll just disappear
Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand me downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
But what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you

Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back


There's a plane or a bus leaving from Dallas
I hope you're on it
If there's a train moving fast down the tracks
I hope you caught it

Because I swear out there ain't where
You ought to be
So catch a ride or catch a cab
Don't you know that I miss you bad
But don't you walk to me

Baby, run
Cut a path across the blue sky
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby, run
So baby, run

Oh, if you ain't got a suitcase
Get a box
Or an old brown paper sack
Pack it light or pack it heavy
Take a truck, take a Chevy

Baby, just come back
There's a shortcut to the highway out of town
Why don't you take it
Don't let that speed limit slow you down
Go on and break it
Baby, break it

And run
Cut a path across the blue sky
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby, run

Run to me
Baby, run
Run to me
So baby, run
Run
Oh baby, run


Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds in different cities
And time, is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons, and darling they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, this train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, for the life of us we can't get back

A beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful

What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair


I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, I'll never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, don't leave me here alone
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window darling
Everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold onto this lullaby
Even when the music's gone
Gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Ooh, (ooh), ooh, (ooh)
La la (la la)
La la (la la)
Ooh, (ooh), ooh, (ooh)
La la (la la)

Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh


Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
I've been an awful good girl, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
Well I'll wait up for you, dear, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the boys I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
I've been an angel all year, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa, honey, there's one more thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine, Santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
And I don't mean on the phone, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight


I stay up too late, got nothing in my brain
That's what people say mmm, that's what people say mm
I go on too many dates, but I can't make 'em stay
At least that's what people say mmm, that's what people say mmm

But I keep cruising, can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music in my body and it's gonna be alright

Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

I'll never miss a beat, I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see mmm, that's what they don't see mmm
I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own), I'll make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know mmm, that's what they don't know mmm

But I keep cruising, can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music in my body saying it's gonna be alright

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

Hey, hey, hey, just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and dirty, dirty cheats in the world you could have been getting down to this sick beat

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like "oh my God", but I'm just gonna shake it
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby, we can shake, shake, shake

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play

Strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything
Is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you
Feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance; it was a moment of weakness
And you said "yes"

You should've said no
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've known that word like what you did with her
Would get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there
In the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be beggin' for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been cryin'
Baby, you know all the right things
To say
But do you, honestly
Expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance; it was a moment of weakness
And you said "yes"

You should've said no
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've known that word like what you did with her
Would get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there
In the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be beggin' for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me

I can't resist
Before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?

No, no
No, no, no, no

You should've said no
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've known that word like what you did with her
Would get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there
In the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be beggin' for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me


Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round young virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing hallelujah
Christ the savior is born
Christ our savior is born

Silent night, holy night
Son of God
Love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Jesus Lord at thy birth

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Christ the savior is born


Let's watch the tide chase the waves onto the sand 
I wonder if a broken heart feel the warmth on my hand 
Don't wonder how a piece of driftwood could see more through his lifetime 
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights 

I've seen a million things 
spoke a million words 
now i only want to speak to you 

Waiting for the words 
counting every bird 
there's nothing i'd rather do 
on smokey black nights 

Still through the haze i can make out constellations 
I'll make one of you and me as we sit in the sand 
And i saw that sunset gleamin as my eyes went wild 
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights 

I've played a thousand songs 
sang a thousand words 
now i only want to sing to you 

Waited on a wire 
starin at the fire 
there's nothing i'd rather do 
on the smokey black nights 

Yeah 

I've walked a thousand miles 
smiled a thousand smiles 
Now I only smile when I'm with you 


Waiting for the words 
counting every bird 
there's nothing i'd rather do 
on the smokey black nights 

So walk with me 
As the sweet wind dances 
I'm writing a song for you and me 
On the smokey black nights


The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far

And you stood there in front of me just
Close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something that'll haunt me whenever you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly, when you smile

My mind forgets to remind me, your a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you, imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know its no good
And I could wait patiently
But I really wish you would

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile

I run my fingers through your hair
And watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
Its just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
And I'm captivated by you baby
Like a fireworks show

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile

When sparks fly oh baby smile
When sparks fly


I am not the kind of girl,
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion,
But you are not the kind of boy,
Who should be marryin' the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends,
And her snotty little family, all dressed in pastel,
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid,
Somewhere back inside a room,
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry,
This is surely not what you thought it would be,
I lose myself in a daydream,
Where I stand and say

"Don't say yes, run away now,
I'll meet you when you're out,
Of the church at the back door,
Don't wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,"
And they said, "Speak now"

Fond gestures are exchanged,
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march,
And I am hiding in the curtains,
It seems I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be,
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen,
But I know you wish it was me,
You wish it was me, don't you?

Don't say yes, run away now,
I'll meet you when you're out,
Of the church at the back door,
Don't wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said, "Speak now"

Don't say yes, run away now,
I'll meet you when you're out,
Of the church at the back door,
Don't wait or say a single vow,
Your time is running out,
And they said, "Speak now"

I hear the preacher say,
"Speak now or forever hold your peace,"
There's a silence, there's my last chance,
I stand up with shaking hands,
All eyes on me,
Horrified looks from everyone in the room,
But I'm only lookin' at you

I am not the kind of girl,
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion,
But you are not the kind of boy,
Who should be marryin' the wrong girl

Don't say yes, run away now,
I'll meet you when you're out,
Of the church at the back door,
Don't wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said, "Speak now"

And you say, "Let's run away now,
I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door,
Oh baby, I didn't say my vow,
So glad you were around when they said, "Speak now"


Days go by, I wonder if you here me
Can't you read between the lines?
Now I'm standing still, I am disappearing
Take this chance, I'll make you mine

Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

He tells lies, are you really thinking
That you deserve another try
When you see these eyes
You see another planet
Don't ask how, but fate decides

Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning and turning
And living and learning
I should be able to handle this
Make it or break it
Move it or shake it
Do it or fake it
Girl you've got to make it

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And all I see is you


I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up late one night at the window,
We were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song he was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, "Look at you, worrying so much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way"
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me,
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

Like "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh ooh he's talking crazy
Ooh ooh dancing with me
Ooh ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?


I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know
Is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon boom
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs
Four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right


Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles; it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home
Saying, does he know
Will you ever know?

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love; don't you know?
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you've looked for
I hope your love leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't, stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say "hey, by the way

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love; don't you know?
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you've looked for
I hope your love leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't, stay beautiful

If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold, at least you'll know

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love; don't you know?
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you've looked for
I hope your love leads you back to my front door
Oh, but if it don't
Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
Na, na, na, na, na


I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away
But you stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said "okay, let's talk."

And I said,
Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
That took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to

Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hangin' out with you, all the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life

Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is going to love me, when I get mad, mad mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay


Let me know how's it feel 
To be under my skin 
Wrapped around my heart 
Is it like anywhere you've been? 
And everything I do I do it just for you 

So why the hell don't you love me? 
Why the hell don't you need me 
Like I need you?
Are you so far above me? 
Don't you know there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy 
That's what you destroyed 
Stupid Boy 

I have been looking in 
Tryin' to read your mind 
Give you the benefit of the doubt 
Every single time 
But didn't you walk right by 
I'm screamin' out inside 

So why the hell don't you love me? 
Why the hell don't you need me? 
Like I need you 
Why are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?

But I was just a toy 
That's what you destroyed 
Stupid Boy 

What happens when you wake up 
And see what you've lost 
Take one look at me 'cause 
That's what it cost 
I was gonna be everything you need 
Cause you are everything to me 

So why the hell won't you love me? 
Why the hell won't you need me? 
Like I need you 
Why are you so far above me? 
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy 
That's what you destroyed 
Stupid Boy 

Let me know how's it feel 
To be under my skin


Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
The end of you, oh,
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch it go round and round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl fate and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

So it goes, he can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home, lights are off he's taking off his coat (Hm yeah)
I say "I've heard that you've been out and about with some other girl"
(Some other girl)
He says "What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you and I."
I said "I've been there too a few times"

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl fate and a tight little skirt (A tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go (We never go) out of style, we never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah just take me home, oh

(Out of style) You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style


Tall dark and Superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
Hes got his mothers eyes, his fathers ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
And I know every word that you say, yay
You smile and say, "How are you?"
And I'll say, "Just fine"
I always forget to tell you,
I love you, I love you, forever

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Talk dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's so irrational
But I hope someday you take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep browns eyes has me singin'
He's not as bad like this reputation
I can't hear one single word they said, no
You really got places to be and I'll be old then
I always forget to tell you I love you,
I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't take some other girl
I hope you don't forget about me
I'm far away but I'll never let you go
I'm lovestruck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you

'Cause I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today to save the world
I'll be around forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

La, la, la

When you come back down


This is wrong but
I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face

And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar

Good morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today you'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face I'd be
Counting down the ways to see you
And you smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar
Sweet, sweet superstar
Superstar


Tire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
Whistle County creek
Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass
Baby, you were watching me
Cold barn struck bed, everything you said
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
Just like the two of us
Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
Guess I loved you way too much
But I'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder
But it's still soft enough to cry
Because I remember those times

I remember . . .

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Saw you just the other day
All that I could think to say was
"Hey, how have you been?"
You caught me with that old smile
Said, "It's really been a while
And I still think about back when . . ."

We used to get high on the first kiss
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and now I'm someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Oh, that's what I learned from you
That's what I learned from you, oh you, oh
That's what I learned from you, oh yeah


Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you hear is "no"
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and I, I, I, I

Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh eh
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

And there you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
Your eyes' wider than distance
This life's sweeter than fiction

Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're onto something, I, I, I say

What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

And there you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
Your eyes' wider than distance
This life's sweeter than fiction

There you'll stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes' wider than distance
This life's sweeter than fiction, fiction

I'll be one of the many saying,
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I'll be one of the many saying,
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
I'll be one of the many saying,
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I'll be one of the many saying,
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud

And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when, when you

Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was "no"
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever (forever)

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
Your eyes' wider than distance
This life's sweeter than fiction

There you'll stand next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes' wider than distance
This life's sweeter than fiction, fiction

It's sweeter than fiction
It's sweeter, yeah
It's sweeter than, sweeter
Sweeter than fiction


Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it is just so funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe
Get some sleep tonight

Because he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see


I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me then you cut me down

And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Well I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh

I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around

And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

Why, do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside
Why, do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind

Well I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in

You ask me for my love then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why
Why, tell me why

I take a step back, let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know


You were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldn't have
You were country lovin' really somethin' for three months and a half

Everybody said that you were bad news
But baby I was betting on you

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

I said let them say we're crazy, you said let's go fishing a lot
The midnight moon was blazing baby, I was gazing into your eyes

Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

Can't believe the time you lost me
Can't believe what it cost me

Cause I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big ol serving to pay back
I had to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
You ain't never been through that
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack


I said I know
He said I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this
and I watched him go
He watched me crash to the floor
On my knees just like that

He said when can I come back
I said, that's when, when I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or stormin'
Laughing when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when I never see your face
I let you in, baby that's when

I said I know
He said I did you wrong, made mistakes
Put you through all of this
'Cause I let you go, you let me think
That I'd be fine without you
Imagine that!
So baby when can I come back?
And I said, that's when, when I wake up in the morning
That's when , when it's sunny or stormin'
Laughing when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when I never see your face
I let you in, baby that's when
And I said all this playing
Did you ever think of me?
And he said

that's when, when I woke up in the morning
that's when, when it's sunny or stormin'
Laughing when I was crying,
and that's when you were waiting at the front gate
that's when, when I saw youR fAce
You let me in, and baby that's when

that's when ooooooh. ooh oh ooh oh oh
I said I know
he said I need some time, need some space





I'm five years old
It's getting cold
I've got my big coat on

I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch
And the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs
And fall asleep on the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how
My friends could be so mean
I come home crying
And you hold me tight
And grab the keys

And we drive and drive
Until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop
'Till I forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing
On the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out he's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house
And I had space to run and I
had the best days with you

There is a video I found
From back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
And you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships
And the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now I know why the all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side
Even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine and

I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today.


Find myself at your door,
Just like all those times before,
I'm not sure how I got there,
All roads they lead me here

I imagine you are home,
In your room, all alone,
And you open your eyes into mine,
And everything feels better,

Right before your eyes,
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why,
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

You find yourself at my door,
Just like all those times before,
You wear your best apology,
But I was there to watch you leave,

And all the times I let you in,
Just for you to go again,
Disappear when you come back,
Everything is better

Right before your eyes,
I'm aching, no past
Nowhere to hide,
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong,
This is the last time I say it's been you all along,
This is the last time I let you in my door,
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore

Oh, oh, oh,

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

This is the last time I'm asking you this (this is the last time I'm asking you this)
Put my name at the top of your list (put my name on the top of your list)
This is the last time I'm asking you why (this is the last time I'm asking you why)
You break my heart in the blink of an eye (You break my heart)

This is the last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you this

This is the last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you this

This is the last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you this

This is the last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you this


New to town with a made up name in the Angel city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties' queen

Another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh

Now it's big black cars, and Riviera views,
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page

And they tell you that you're lucky
But you're so confused,
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere,
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square,
And it took some time, but I understand it now

'Cause now my name is up in lights,
But I think you got it right,

Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh

Yeah they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, oh, oh


You should've been there,
Should've burst through the door,
With that 'baby I'm right here' smile,
And it would've felt like,
A million little shining stars had just aligned,
And I would've been so happy.

Christmas lights glisten,
I've got my eye on the door,
Just waiting for you to walk in,
But the time is ticking,
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory,
How you said you'd be here,
You said you'd be here.

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all laughing,
As I'm looking around the room,
But there was one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

And the hours pass by,
Now I just wanna be alone,
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong,
So they follow me down the hall,
And there in the bathroom,
I try not to fall apart,
And the sinking feeling starts,
As I say hopelessly,
"He said he'd be here."

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all laughing,
And asking me about you,
But there was one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do when the one
Who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should've been here.
And I would've been so happy.

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all standing around me singing
"Happy birthday to you",
But there was one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

Ooh, I knew.
Ooh,

You called me later,
And said, "I'm sorry, I didn't make it,"
And I said, "I'm sorry too,"
And that was the moment I knew.


In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said, 'This time I've had enough'
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up
'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride, sitting here alone
Going through the photographs
Staring at the phone
I keep going back over, things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread
So babe if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
That when I left I wanted you to chase after me

Yeah, I said leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, 'there's nothing you can say
To make this right again'
I mean it, I mean it, what I mean I

I said leave but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, wish it weren't this mess
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you


I didn't know what I would find
When I went lookin' for a reason I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothin' seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
And I can still see you; this ain't the best view
On the outside, lookin' in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late, so you see
You could have helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too late to do anything

How could I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
And I can still see you; this ain't the best view
On the outside, lookin' in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh, yeah

How can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
And I can still see you; this ain't the best view
On the outside, lookin' in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh, oh
Oh, oh,
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh


I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
People would say, "they're the lucky ones"

I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fall out
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up I can't break through

Now I'm standing alone In a crowded room
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now next chapter

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes
And trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should have held me
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you'd say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now, the end


If I could escape 
I would, but first of all let me say 
I must apologize for acting, stinking, treating you this way
Because I've been acting like sour milk that fell on the floor 
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator 
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold 

If I could escape 
And recreate a place as my own world 
And I could be your favorite girl 
Forever, perfectly together 
Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? 

If I could be sweet 
I know I've been a real bad girl 
I didn't mean for you to get hurt 
(Forever) We can make it better 
Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? 
(Sweet escape)

(I want to get away
To our sweet escape
I want to get away
Yeah)

You let me down 
I'm at my lowest boiling point 
Come help me out 
I need to get me out of this joint 
Come on, let's bounce 
Counting on you to turn me around 
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground 

So, baby, times getting a little crazy 
I've been getting a little lazy 
Waiting for you to come save me 
I can see that you're angry 
By the way the you treat me 
Hopefully you don't leave me 
Want to take you with me 

If I could escape 
And recreate a place as my own world 
And I could be your favorite girl 
Forever, perfectly together 
Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? 

If I could be sweet 
I know I've been a real bad girl 
I didn't mean for you to get hurt 
(Forever) We can make it better 
Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? 
(Sweet escape)

(If I could escape
If I could escape)

Because I've been acting like sour milk that fell on the floor 
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator 
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold 

If I could escape 
And recreate a place in my own world 
And I could be your favorite girl 
Forever, perfectly together 
Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? 

If I could be sweet 
I know I've been a real bad girl 
I didn't mean for you to get hurt 
(Forever) We can make it better 
Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape)

(I want to get away
To our sweet escape
I want to get away
Yeah)


He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating intoxicating
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you


Beneath the chandelier of star and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows open up
The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound
It's like I'm melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move 
and

Tell me 
You'll never leave me 
that I'm not crazy
and this is really happening 
That this is really happening

Could this be better?
You write me letters 
though you see me everyday
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights 
It really blows me away 

Lock me up in a dark room
And I still can't take my eyes off you 

Tell me 
You'll never leave me 
and I'm not crazy and
This is really happening 
That this is really happening

All those kisses up against your car 
For all those wishes on planes 
We thought were stars
Memories like photographs 
Oh baby, here we are

Tell me 
You'll never leave me 
and I'm not crazy and
Oh and this is really happening 
That this is really happening
Oh,Oh,Baby 

Tell me 
You'll always need me 
That I drive you crazy
And this is really happening
Oh, that this is really happening

Tell me, Oh
You'll always need me 
(need me ,tell me)
(Baby)
That I drive you crazy
(Oh)
That this is really happening


Clear blue water
High tide, came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on
And I will, scars grow darker, currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
In silent screams, and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good
This love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh
Oh, oh

Tossing, turning, struggle through the night for someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lanterns burning, flickered in the mind only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone,
Been losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up, just in time

This love is good
This love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh

This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love

Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young, just to run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good
This love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And, this love came back to me, oh

(This love) This love that's a permanent mark
(This love) This love is glowing in the dark, oh
(This love) These hands had to let it go free
(This love) And this love came back to me, oh

This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love (This love came back to me, oh)


I'm like eight foot four, blond hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore

No I ain't got a gun
No I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents
But I'm still a thug

I'm so gangsta you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing, well I just baked Caramel Delights
T Swift and T Pain rappin' on the same track
It's a thug story tell me can you get with that

I had a dream last night I had high-top Nikes
I had diamonds in my mouth, and diamonds on my mic
By the time I woke I was singing "I'm on a boat"

'Cause I'm a singer turned rapper
Shorty I'm a make ya
Straight to the top, yo
Shorty I'ma take ya

You can call me T Sweezy now I'm a rap star
Hey it's a thug story now tell them who you are

Singer turned gangsta
You don't wanna fight me
Straight to the top
In my extra small white tee

T Swift and T Pain all up on the same track
It's a thug story tell now can you get with that

What! what! I knit sweaters yo!
What! what! don't test me

Hey hold on, hold on I didn't even say anything
What? I said "yo"
Yo, you guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
I didn't even swear
She didn't even swear
Hello?  Ugh!


Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true 'cause I know you

Hold on, baby; you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go, and no one knows
That you cry; but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're givin' it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay

Hold on, baby; you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go, and no one knows
That you cry; but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

Hold on, baby; you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go, and no one knows
That you cry; but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

You're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh
Goodbye, baby
With a smile, baby, baby


Do you remember the day
I leaned up against your car
And it started rolling down the street
You screamed and ran after it
And tried to open the door
And it ran over your foot
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
Because they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
Because that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
And you said it reminded you of me
And I threw the remote at you
And you said, "My point exactly"
And later on that night, under the neon city lights
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
Because they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
Because that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

You call me lucky because I lose everything
But I swear I'd be careful with it
If you gave me a ring

And it would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
Because they don't play our song
I wish that pretty girls wouldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
Because that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along
Until Brad Pitt comes along
Yeah, oh, oh
Until Brad Pitt comes along


He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said: "That's a lie."
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On back roads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer had gone

But when you think "Tim McGraw"
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think "that little black dress"
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

But when you think "Tim McGraw"
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think "that little black dress"
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read

Is when you think "Tim McGraw"
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think "that little black dress"
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

Oh, think of me
Mmm

You said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie."


Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down whenever you're around

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile that takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothin' made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down whenever you're around
Yeah yeah

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Oh oh yeah yeah oh
Today was a fairytale


The lies are always better left unsaid
So take the photos down of the wall
There's nothing left to talk about
We're in a plane and I want out
From all these stories that people tell
Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
I guess it feels worse
Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
I guess it feels worse
When you have to pretend you lose the person that you were in life
When you're trying to fix, you never feel ecstatic and alive
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Now you know exactly how I feel
The truth is out and I can see what's real
There's nothing left to talk about
We're in a scene and I want out
From all these stories that people tell
Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
I guess it feels worse
Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
I guess it feels worse
When you have to pretend you lose the person that you were in life
When you're trying to fix, you never feel ecstatic and alive
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Tonight is our last night alone dear
When you have to pretend you lose the person that you were in life
When you're trying to fix, you never feel ecstatic and alive
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night 



Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away,
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow,
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, and get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I I, I, I I, I, I

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, and get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it


I remember what you wore on our first date
You came into my life
And I thought hey
You know this could be something
'Cause everything you do and words you say
You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing

So maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
Well maybe two is better than one
There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two, is better than one

I remember every look upon your face,
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
I'm finally now believin'

And maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
Well maybe two is better than one
There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two, is better than one



I remember what you wore on the first date
You came into my life
And I thought hey

Maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
Maybe two is better than one
There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking

Oooh I can't live without you
'Cause baby two is better than one
There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And I've figured out with all that's said and done
Two, is better than one

Two is better than one


You had my heart, we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines but you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
That's when you need me there, with you I'll always share

Because when the sun shines we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay
Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

Just trying to get your attention


Untouchable like
A distant diamond sky

I'm reaching out
And I just
Can't tell you why

I'm caught up in you
I'm caught up in you

Untouchable burning
Brighter than the sun
And when you're close
I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like
A million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of heaven

It's half full
And I won't wait here
All day
I know you're saying
That you'd be here
Anyway

But you're
Untouchable burning
Brighter than the sun
Now that you're close
I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like
A million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta, come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on

In the middle of the night
Wakin' from this dream
I wanna feel you
By my side
Standing next to me
You gotta, come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of heaven

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
I'm caught
Up in you
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

It's your
Untouchable burning
Brighter than the sun
Now that you're close
I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like
A million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Oh, oh

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like
A million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta, come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Come on

In the middle of the night
We can form this dream
I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me
You gotta, come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of heaven


If you had only gotten to me first
If I could write a book on how this hurts
You could see the way your smile looks to me

If I wasn't scared of the world alone
If I didn't know he loves me so
If I could only find the strength to leave
You would be with me, so baby

Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go, I hope you think of me

As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging, wait for me

It's so wrong that all I wanna do
Is forget it all and just be with you
I have to go 'cause he don't know
But the writing's on the wall

But here we are in so deep
Soaking wet
Jumping in without no safety net
And I don't know what kinda ropes
Would break this kinda fall, so baby

Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go, I hope you think of me

As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait, wait for me

We can't be together right now
Guess there's no use in trying
But if you look at me right now
Can you tell that I'm dying
To hold you?
But it would be wrong to

So don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go, I hope you think of me

As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging, wait for me

Don't you look now
Don't you look now
I might fall in love
Don't you look now


I remember when we broke up, the first time
Saying, this is it, I've had enough
'Cause like we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you, said you, needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you

Oh we called it off again last night
But oh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever, ever getting back together
We are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together

Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you, would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Oh, you called me up again tonight
But oh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever, ever getting back together
We, are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
But, we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh oh oh

I used to think that we were forever ever, ever
And I used to say, never say never
Huh, so he calls me up and he's like, I still love you
And I'm like I just I mean this is exhausting, you know, like
We are never getting back together like, ever

(No!) We are never ever, ever getting back together
We, are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we, are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, are not getting back together,
We oh, not getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together


We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be back when we had all night
And we were happy.

I do recall a good while back we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it
And we were happy.

When it was good baby, it was good baby
We showed 'em all up, no one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark talkin' bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
We were happy.

We used to watch the sun go down 
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder
Because we were happy.

When it was good baby, it was good baby
We showed 'em all up, no one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark talkin' bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
We were happy.

Oh I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices, that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy
We were happy.

When it was good baby, it was good baby
We showed 'em all up, no one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark talkin' bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
And we were happy, yeah we were happy.
Oh, oh. We were happy.


I got a little thing I call self control
'Cause I get a little crazy 
When I let too much go
Love's a little messy and you are too
Right now I'm scared of both of you
I laugh and I play and I wasn't gonna stray 
Swore I'd never let a man in my way

You're the last thing I needed today

And I don't know 
Where I lost control
And couldn't take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can't win so I give in 
The more I fight it just get's stronger
You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction

Gone and spilled my coffee 
Tryna get to the phone
'Cause it might be you
You just never know
Can't talk to my friends 
Without you coming up
It's even kind of cute 
The way you cuss
I wrote your name down 
A hundred thousand times
'Cause it looks so good 
Right next to mine

You're the last thing I needed tonight

And I don't know 
Where I lost control
And couldn't take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can't win so I give in 
The more I fight it just get's stronger
You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction

I'm acting like a girl 
With nothing to lose
When did I stop caring 
About anything but you

And I don't know 
Where I lost control
And couldn't take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can't win so I give in 
The more I fight it just get's stronger
You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction

Welcome distraction, welcome distraction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction oh oh


Walkin' through a crowd, the village is a glow
Kaleidoscope of a loud, hide beats under coats
Everybody here wanted somethin' more
Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts and put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York (New York!)
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything

Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright but they never blind me
Welcome to New York
New soundtrack
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York
The lights are so bright but they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright, they never blind me
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York


What do you say when you just know
That he's the won and you wanna go fast but he's taking it slow?
And what do you do when he's next to you but he's a little bit shy?
Well here's something you could try

Hey, hey, what do you say?
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May, beautiful day and I feel like I could talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright it feels just like a day 
When everything's gonna go just right.
I know it will be a sweet memory for you and me someday-ay-ay-ay-yeah
What do you say?

What do you see when you look in his eyes?
There's something there that he can't disguise
No matter how he tries.
And what do you feel when you know it's real
And you can't sit still if you don't own up I will, yeah.

Hey, hey, what do you say?
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May, beautiful day and I feel like I could talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright it feels just like a day 
When everything's gonna go just right.
I know it will be a sweet memory for you and me someday-ay-ay-ay-yeah
What do you say?

My imagination's running away
Just dreaming about what I want you to say.

Hey, hey, what do you say?
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May, beautiful day and I feel like I could talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright it feels just like a day 
When everything's gonna go just right. 
I know it will be a sweet memory for you and me someday-ay-ay-ay-yeah
What do you say? 
What do you say?
What do you say?
(What do you say?)



It's this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were going to make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
Because I know that you're living a lie
That's okay baby, because in time you will find . . .

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't want to hurt anymore
And you tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, goes around
Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no, no 

You're not sorry, oh no, no, no

And every time you call him
You spend your nights alone
And he never comes home
And every time you call him
All you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out
That he's doing to you
What you did to me
Girl, you got what you deserved


Shes looking in the mirror
The moments getting nearer
She thinks about it as she walks her walk
Up and down the staircase
Makeup fresh on her face
She thinks about it as she talks her talk
School dance, first chance, always been a dreamer
Theres one guy, shes shy, sees him through the mirror
And everybody looks at her,
She thinks about it

Blue dress angel face, looking in the mirror,
Shoes,purse, hair tied back and you should see her,
Shes got her magic, floating through the air,


Peace,Love,One thing leads into another
Dream big,Aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wonderin' what to wear

She's standing in her bedroom
He'll be pullin' up soon
She thinks about it as she sees headlights
Looking out the window she's got her diary to show
That she's been waiting for this all her life
First date,can't wait
Lookin' in the mirror
Heart all wrapped up
Wait until he sees her
He's lookin' right at her
She thinks about it

Sixteen blue jeans Abercrombie t-shirt
Shoes purse hair tied back and you should see her
She's got her magic floating through the air

Peace, Love,One thing leads into another
Dream big, Aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wonderin' what to wear

The years went by
The mirror saw her cry
She got up again
She got up again
The wind blew by the small town lights
She got up again

Move out
Find out where the world can take her
Bright lights late nights livin' for the greater
Move to Paris livin' on a prayer

Peace, Love,One thing leads into another
Dream big, Aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wonderin' what to wear
Ooo Ooo
Wonderin' what to wear


I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
So may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white


Say you're sorry
That face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on
The days drag on
Stupid girl,
I should have known, I should have known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you
And your white horse, to come around

Maybe I was naive,
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings
Now I know

I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you
And your white horse, to come around

And there you are on your knees,
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And its too late for you and your white horse
Now its too late for you and your white horse, to catch me now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now
Oh, it's too late
To catch me now


You walk in here with your guitar, man
Your shiny boots and your full-on band
A smile on your face, a knife in your hand
Singing songs you got to memorize
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your hands

Don't worry yourself, I ain't your competition
Don't flatter yourself, that was never my intention

I want to talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you in an empty room
And who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be
And who I've always been

I walk in here with a beat-up case
The same guitar I've always played
And the words I wrote down on a page
When I was twelve years old and small town raised
You tell the crowd you're paying dues
I'd tell them this is what I do
And it's what I put my life into
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume

They say life on music row is rough conditions
Oh, but the easy ride was never my ambition

I want to talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you in an empty room
And who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be
And who I've always been

Let's talk about your childhood days
You were the prom queen, I was on this stage
So where's that crown gotten you these days?
When it's me and you and the same damn games
So what've you got that I ain't?
And what do you do that I can't?
Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be, girl
And who I've always been


He said let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city
Away from the crowds
I thought heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall, and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins my one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams (Ah ah)
Wildest dreams (Ah ah)

I said no one has to know what we do
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now
He's so tall, and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
But my last request is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams (Ah ah) (Ah ah)
Wildest dreams (Ah ah)

You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burn it down
Some day when you leave me
I bet these memories hunt you around
You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burn it down (Burn it down)
Some day when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around (Follow you around)

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just pretend

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just (Just pretend, just pretend) in your wildest dreams (Ah ah)
In your wildest dreams (Ah ah)
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams (Ah ah)
In your wildest dreams (Ah ah)


Flashing lights and we, took a wrong turn and we
Fell down the rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
Spinning out of control
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds
Ooh didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should've slept with one eye opened at night

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better, eh
In wonderland, eh
In wonderland, eh
In wonderland, eh
In wonderland

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Didn't you call my fears with the treacherous cat's smile
Ooh didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games, still somebody loses their mind

Oh darling, we found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better, eh
In wonderland, eh
In wonderland, eh
In wonderland, eh
(In won-) In wonderland

I reach for you
But you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad

Oh, we found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh (Last forever)
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better, eh (Never better)
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (Wonderland)
And we pretended it could last forever, eh (In wonderland)
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (Wonderland)
And life was never worse but never better

In wonderland


I can't believe you did it again, walked by and took my heart with you
Why'd you have to look so good? 
Don't you know I'm trying to hate you?
Trying to have a dream without you in it
But how can I put out this fire when you're the one who lit it?

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
Until I do, I'll keep writing songs about you.

I've got a stack of papers so high and it's all about you, baby
Keep thinking maybe I can make sense of something crazy
Something I can't get out of my head
I write your name, I write your name 
Then I tear it all to shreds!

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
Until I do, I'll keep writing songs about you.

And if you ever change your mind and want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me why I shouldn't let you in.

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay 'cause I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
'Til I do I'll just wait for the day that I stop pretending that
I'm really okay when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
'Til I do, I'll keep writing songs about you.


One look, dark room
Men just for you
Time moved too fast
You played it back
Buttons on a coat
Light hearted joke
No proof not much
But you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight, the light reflects
The chain on your neck
He says look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
You felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out,
You are in love, true love
You are in love

Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word
And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kissed on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says, you're my best friend
And you knew what it was, he is in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love

So it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, go round and round
And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
You understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life try to put it into words

'Cause you can hear in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love
You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love


You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room
It's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do'

But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you can see I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey isn't this easy

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say your fine
I know you better then that
Hey what you doing with a girl like that

She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with me

Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong
I think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time
How could you not know
Baby you belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me


You did it.  I can't believe you did it.
Why were you so blind?

You brought her to my party.
Did you think my friends wouldn't know?
Did you think I wouldn't care?

You asked if it was okay.
I didn't know what to say.
I lied.  What is left of today?

You did it.  I can't believe you did it.
Why were you so blind?

You still don't understand.
Why was I so hurt?  
We were just friends you say.
But no more.

You did it.  I can't believe you did it.
Why were you so blind?

She did me a favor when 
calling you on the phone.
She started the ball a-rolling when you 
didn't follow up.  That best friend of hers 
put the ball in play.

You did it.  I can't believe you did it.
Why were you so blind?

I'm free. Lesson learned.  
Cleansed from your curse.  Places 
I no longer want to be.

Now you're going backwards.
No more my life to share.
A mistake you're sure to repeat.
Not my problem now.

You did it.  I can't believe you did it.
What action should I take?
Turn the cheek?  More hurt to bear?

She did me a favor.  Now I'm free
Lesson learned.  Cleansed from 
your curse.  No more in your life to be.


(Hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey)
People like you always want back the love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
The more I think about it now the less I know
All I know is that you drove us off the road

Stay, hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye

Stay, hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay (Stay, stay, stay)

Let me remind you this was what you wanted (Oh oh oh)
You ended it
You were all I wanted (Oh oh oh)
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this
Oh, all you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy (All you had to do was stay)
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay (Oh)
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay (Ooh)


You dont have to call me 
And say your sorry
I'm already gone

you dont have to call me
and break my heart each time
I try moving on

You dont have to call anymore oh yeah
You dont have to call baby


[Instrumental]


All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taking me this long
Baby but I figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no no, no no

Looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no no

You're not sorry, no no

You had me crawling for you honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw there's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before you're not sorry
No, no, no

You're not sorry, no no (no)


I bet you lie awake at night trying to make up your sweet mind 
wonderin if you'll ever find just what you want 
a hometown number one 
or a california loaded gun
but you you'll only get one 
ohh thats what you thought 
and heres what you got

i could be your baby blue jeans 
with the holes in the knees
in the bottom of the top drawer 
i could be a little beauty queen just a little out of reach 
or the girl living next door
i'll be your angel giving up her wings 
if thats what you need 
i'd give everything to be your anyhting 
be your anything

if you want hard to get 
if you want (laugh)
all you have to do is let me know
if you want a bumby ride 
or someone with a softer side 
either one will be alright 
just let me know
cause this is how it goes 

i could be your baby blue jeans 
with the holes in the knees

in the bottom of the top drawer 
i could be a little beauty queen just a little out of reach 
or the girl living next door
i'll be your angel giving up her wings 
if thats what you need 
i'd give everything to be your anyhting 

it's not like i'm giving up who i am for you
but with someone like you it's so easy to do
and 

i could be your baby blue jeans 
with the holes in the knees
in the bottom of the top drawer 
i could be a little beauty queen just a little out of reach 
or the girl living next door
i'll be your angel giving up her wings 
if thats what you need 
thats what you need 

i could be your baby blue jeans 
with the holes in the knees
in the bottom of the top drawer 
i could be a little beauty queen just a little out of reach 
or the girl living next door
i'll be your angel giving up her wings 
if thats what you need 
i'd give everything to be your anyhting 



i heard a song tonight on the radio
another girl sings about a boy
she sees his face in every space, every room
and i know that if i turn around you won't be there
if i close my eyes will you be there?

[chorus]
i don't wanna lose your face
i don't wanna wake up one day
and not remember what time erased
and i don't wanna turn around
cause i'm not scared of 
what love gave me and took away
and i don't wanna lose your face

i've got a picture of you in my bedroom
and i hope it never falls
i hope i never lose that feelin'
i used to get when you called
and i wonder to myself
who were you? where are you? were you ever here at all?

[chorus]
i don't wanna lose your face
i don't wanna wake up one day
and not remember what time erased
and i don't wanna turn around
cause i'm not scared of 
what love gave me and took away
and i don't wanna lose your face

that girl in the song had it so good
i wish i could close my eyes and see you
i wish the sky had your face 
and the oceans has your eyes
and the sun that had your lips
and i had you, ohhhh yeah

[chorus]
i don't wanna lose your face
i don't wanna wake up one day
and not remember what time erased
and i don't wanna turn around
cause i'm not scared of 
what love gave me and took away
and i don't wanna lose your face
ohhh, no, no

i don't wanna lose your face
i don't wanna turn around
oh oh oh oh, yeah
oh, oh, ohhhh
oh, oh, ohhhh
oh, oh, ohhhh yeah
