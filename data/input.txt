It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh uh uh uh
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers uh uh uh uh
Yeah
We're happy free confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines, it's time uh oh

I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright, if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright, if we just keep dancing like we're 22, 22

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded, too many cool kids uh uh, uh uh
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming instead of sleeping
Yeah
We're happy free confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical oh yeah
Tonight's the night, when we forget about the heartbreaks, it's time uh oh

I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22 uh uh ah ah ah 22 uh uh uh

I don't know about you, 22 uh uh 22 uh uh

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news I gotta have you, I gotta have you ohh, uh, yeah

I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22 uh uh, 22 uh uoh,

22 uh uh, yeah, 22 uh uhoo, yeah yeah

It feels like one of those nights uh uh
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights uh uh
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights uh uh
You look like bad news I gotta have you, I gotta have you


Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart

Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say I still can't believe
That you would walk away
It don't make sense to me but

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart

It's not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart


I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road
I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one, who feels
The way I do

I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know,
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl
Trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need?
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's okay

I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know,
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl
Trying to find a place in this world

Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly

I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know
Oh, I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know
Oh, I'm just a girl
Trying to find a place in this world

Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl, oh, oh
Oh, I'm just a girl


The way you look, the way you laugh the way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry the way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me.

Once I thought that love was something that I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough!

The way you look, the way you laugh the way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry the way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me.

Woah, oh, oh, oh...

In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Boy you got everything.

The way you look, the way you laugh the way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry the way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me.

I love your attitude, all your tattoos, your every thought
Your smile. your lips, and boy the list goes on and on and on!

(The way you look, the way you laugh) the way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry the way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me.

The way you look, the way you laugh the way you love with all you have
Your dance, your drive, you make me feel alive
Now I think you see there ain't nothing about you
That don't do something for me.


I wake up, I stretch out
I wonder what you're doing right now
Yeah, I slept in my makeup again
Tell myself I must be crazy,
Thinking about him

I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel out of my hair
About that time, you call me
And I'm reminded, without you I'd be

[Chorus]
A stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for her love to find her
Lonely like a harbor line
Thats never seen a boat
Just like a line in an old love letter
No one wrote

I go to work, work all day
I'm a walking tape recorder of everything you say
Walk to my car, dig out my keys
Start thinking if you were with anyone but me

[Chorus]
A stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for her love to find her
Lonely like a harbor line
That's never seen a boat
Just like a line in an old love letter
No one wrote

There you are, on the street
Standing there all waiting on me
Yeah, I show you, my new shoes
You say you love em, and baby without you,
I'd be

[Chorus]
A stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for her love to find her
Lonely like a harbor line
Thats never seen a boat
Just like a line in an old love letter
No one wrote

I wake up, I stretch out
Wonder what you're doing right now


I walked through the door with you, the air was cold,
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house,
And you still got it in your drawer even now.

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze.
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate.
The Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,
And I can picture it after all these days.

And I know it's long gone,
And that magic's not here no more,
And I might be okay,
But I'm not fine at all.

'Cause there we are again on that little town street.
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me.
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well.

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red.
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-size bed
And your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team
You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me.

And I know it's long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night.
We dance around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah.

Maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much,
And maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up.
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well.

Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise.
So casually cruel in the name of being honest.
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well.

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it, 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well


(Hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey)
People like you always want back the love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
The more I think about it now the less I know
All I know is that you drove us off the road

Stay, hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye

Stay, hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay (Stay, stay, stay)

Let me remind you this was what you wanted (Oh oh oh)
You ended it
You were all I wanted (Oh oh oh)
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this
Oh, all you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy (All you had to do was stay)
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay (Oh)
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay (Ooh)

Sometimes I wonder 
How it's going to feel 
Will my first love be true and real?
Will I be ready when 
My heart starts to fall?
What will I do when my love comes to call? 

And my daddy tells me 
That I light up his world 
Every day he says, "Darling 
You're my best girl" 
He tried to teach me 
From the very start 
The meaning of love 
So nobody breaks my heart 

Will my love come in a bowl of fire? 
Will it be filled with hope and desire? 
Will my love come in the pouring rain? 
Am I ready for the joy? 
Am I ready for the pain? 
Am I ready for the boy? 
Am I ready for love? 
For love 

I know I'm not a little 
Girl anymore 
Because I'm feeling things 
I've never felt before 
Sweet sensations 
And anticipations 
Calling commotion 
To my emotions 

And I hear the words 
My daddy says to me 
He said, "Be true to yourself 
And keep your spirit free 
And love will find you 

One way or another 
Be good to yourself 
And be good to each other" 

Will my love come in a bowl of fire? 
Will it be filled with hope and desire? 
Will my love come in the pouring rain? 
Am I ready for the joy? 
Am I ready for the pain? 
Am I ready for the joy? 
Am I ready for the pain? 
Am I ready for love? 

It's a run around the world 
And it's moving so fast 
Though I want to find 
A love that's going to last 
A love so strong 
That it can withstand 
The weight of the world 
In the palm of its hand 

Will my love come in a bowl of fire? 
Will it be filled with hope and desire? 
Will my love come in the pouring rain? 
Am I ready for the joy? 
Am I ready for the pain? 
Am I ready for the joy? 
Am I ready for the pain? 
Am I ready for this game? 
Am I ready for the kiss? 
Am I ready for the stars? 
Am I ready for the bliss? 
Am I ready for love?


American boy, living life as it goes
Sitting on the fence posts
Living in the light
American boy, living in the real world
Trying just to get the girl
Trying to survive

The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill Avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy

Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
Looking for the love
Suddenly rise, an American beauty
Suddenly he cheats, sent from above

The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill Avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The dream of an American boy

American boy, raising little babies
Hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you
Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn
That's grown up, American boy

The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Grandview Avenue
Mama makes her cookies, and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy


Well she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldnt help thinking that there
Was a little more to life
Somewhere else
After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
Yeah, and if she had to die
Trying she had one little promise
She was going to keep

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy, baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

It was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
She could see the cars roll by
Out on 441
Like waves crashing in the beach
And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful
Something that's so close
And still so far out of reach

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy, baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl


I like the way you wanted me
Every night for so long baby
I like the way you needed me
Every time things got rocky

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken do you mean
Do you mean what you say
When you say our love could last forever

(Chorus)
But I'd rather you be mean than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

I like the way you'd hold me
Every night for so long baby
I like the way you'd sing to me
Every time things got rocky


I was believing in you
Was I mistaken do you say
Do you say what you mean
When you say our love could last forever

(Chorus)
Cause I'd rather you be mean than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

(Bridge)
You would run around and lead me on forever
While I stay at home still thinking we're together
I wanted our love to last forever

(Chorus)
But I'd rather you be mean than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow
Baby don't you break my heart slow


I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier then ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I'd loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time all the time


'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood

(Hey!) Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood

(Hey!) Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shining now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak baby I couldn't breathe
I rubbed it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood

(Hey!) Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood

(Hey!) Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
Now did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't
So if you come in my way, just don't
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood

(Hey!) Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood

(Hey!) Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts (Ghosts)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (Hey!)
You say sorry just for show (Hey!)
You live like that, you live with ghosts (Hey!)
Hm, if you love like that blood runs bad

'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood

(Hey!) Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them (Think we can solve them)
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood

('Cause now we got bad blood) 'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done (Look at what you've done)
'Cause baby now we got bad blood (Woah)
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood (Hey!)


You turn your dial to 93.7
Broadway acts like he's 11
Self-proclaimed
Say's he's the worst mistake ever to land in Michigan
I'm just a singer of country songs
Just trying to play guitar and not do no wrong
But if you listen to just one thing I say

You should turn Z93 on
Broadway's Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called Tim McGraw
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothing like when you're on
The Electric Barnyard

Daisy's from a trailer park in St. Louis
Growing up not wearing any shoes
Prettiest hillbilly girl you'll see all day
Growing up the other trailer park girls
Couldn't hide their jealousy
Because she had the only phone for miles
Now she uses it as a DJ

So you should turn Z93 on
Broadway's Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called Tim McGraw
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothing like when you're on


Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into my eyes
And sometimes 
I think of you late at night, I don't know why
I wanna be somewhere where you are
I wanna be where

You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

I wake up, I'm alive
In only a little while, I'll cry
'Cause you're my lullaby
So baby come hold me tight 'cause I-I
I wanna be everything you need
I wanna be where

You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

Just as long as you're mine
I'll be your everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh baby let me miss you, let me see your
Dream about, dream about
Dream about your eyes!
Eyes, eyes, beautiful eyes


Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do

Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl
Who had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies that your family watches
Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that
And for the first time what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months

Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again


All is quiet in the world tonight
Counting stars and fireflies
This summer sings a lullaby
Of just me and my baby

On the hood of his daddy's car
Pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
Just me and my baby

The world is spinning 'round
'Cause of just what I found

Ooh life's so sweet right here
Ooh keeping it young and crazy
Ooh just want to stay right here
'Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

Driving home by the riverside
Wishing I could slow down time
Faking pictures in my mind
Of me and my baby

The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
The back-road was a better way
For me and my baby

The closer that we get
Ooh I can't leave yet

Ooh life's so sweet right here
Ooh keeping it young and crazy
Ooh just want to stay right here
'Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

Both know what we found
So we turned that car around

Ooh life's so sweet right here
Ooh keeping it young and crazy
Ooh just want to stay right here
Ooh and be with my baby
Ooh yeah
And be with my baby


Her hair is Harlowe gold
Her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold
She's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll turn her music on you
You won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow
She got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo stand off sighs
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll let you take her home
It whets her appetite
She'll lay you on her throne
She got Bette Davis eyes
She'll take a tumble on you
Roll you like you were dice
Until you come out blue
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll expose you, when she snows you
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please ya
She's precocious, and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll tease you
She'll unease you
Just to please ya
She's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll expose you, when she snows you
She knows ya
She's got Bette Davis eyes


You live down the street, in a broken down house
And a car up on the blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
That we won't forget this Sunday

It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this, our first kiss

All my friends are saying
Girl what are you thinking?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another,
Girl that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't wanna come down
But they make it so tough

'Cause everyone we know is trying to push us apart,
Putting doubt in our hearts,
And they get what they want, 'cause you're gone

All my friends are saying,
Girl why are you crying?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

You come to my door in the pouring rain
We know what we don't have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
'We don't have to do things their way'

All my friends are saying,
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better


Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And, I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say sabotage
I never saw it coming, nor would I have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling
And, she thinks I'm psycho
'Cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but
Sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school
So it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but I'll always get the last word
Whoa

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

And do you still feel like you know what you're doing,
'Cause I don't think you do, oh
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
C'mon show me how much better you are
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say sabotage


Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, want to play?
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors, lie
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king baby I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storm
I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name


I see your face in my mind as I drive away,
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people,
And sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie,
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,
Now I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple,
Never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,

And I can't,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
People are people,
And sometimes it doesn't work out,
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

And we know it's never simple,
Never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,

And I can't,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to

It's two am
Feelin' like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy,
Easy for me

It's two am
Feelin' like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy,
Easy for me

And we know it's never simple,
Never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me

I can't,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to

Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to

Sorry (oh) sorry
Sorry sorry
Sorry sorry


Here you are now
Fresh from your war
Back from the edge of time
And all that you were
Stripped to the bone
I thought you' d want to know

That when you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

Lay down your guns
Too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart
Broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you won't go again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

I'm so glad to see you smiling
So good to hear your laugh
I think that you've found you even
Missed yourself
I'm only asking this because I think that
Truth be told
Oh, you'll never go again
Again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
Breathless
So when you feel the world is crashing down
I want you come run into my arms


Emily comes home from school
Grabs onto her daddy's hand
He says, "Baby girl, what's wrong with you?"
She says, "Please don't make me go back there again."

She said, "I wish there was someway to make them stop it."
So he drives down to that principles office
And says, "I didn't bring her up so they could cut her down
I didn't bring her here so they could shut her out
I'd live my whole damn life to see that little girl smile
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
She wasn't brought up that way."

Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh but something's different this time
She doesn't have too much to say
She said, "He tried but there's just some things I won't do"
And through the tears she said, "I couldn't do that to you"

And he said, "I didn't bring you up so he could wear you down
Take that innocent heart and turn it inside out
I'd live my whole damn life to see my little girl smile
So don't let nobody take that away
You weren't brought up that way."

The phone rings on a rainy night
Says, "It's Officer Tate"
He said, "Sir, there's been an accident
You'd better come down here right away
A drunken driver missed an overpass
And Emily she's fading fast."

He says, "God I didn't bring her up to watch them lay her  down
Nearly killed me the day they put her mama in the ground
Only thing that kept me alive was that little girls smile
So please don't take that away
It won't be easy taking her today, she wasn't brought up that way."

He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyes


I had to catch my breath when I saw you there 
Across the room holding her hand
I'd never guessed starting over would be so good on you 
But here I am still believing there might come a day
We'll pick up where we left off...

By the way your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way my heart's still breaking
It's going to take me awhile to love again
So many things that I forgot to say, by the way.

I should've let you know all the ways you made me feel alive
Guess it's too late
So I'll just get my coat and make my way into this breezy night
Give you one last wave
Maybe you'll drop what you're doing come over here and say 
"I'm looking good."

But by the way your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way my heart's still breaking
It's going to take me awhile to love again
So many things that I forgot to say.

By the way you still look amazing
And I must've been crazy to let you get away
By the way, if you ever wonder
I still have the same old number just in case.
I still miss you, and I still love you, by the way.
By the way...




Any day now
They're talking war
I can see the light
That's in your eyes
They're not talking
A week or two
Oh, daddy
Can I go with you?
Oh, daddy
Can I go with you?

You pack a suitcase
And take a picture
From the wall
I always knew
This time would come
When I ask how long
You think
You're going to be
You say
"Eh, this crazy world's
Come undone"

Summer's over
And leaves begin
To fall
And another winter's
On the way
I knew
I wasn't going to take
This very well
But I'd give everything
To have you here today

Every day now
They're talking war
I know
This time has been
Like it's never
Been before
We're not talking
About a week or two
Oh, daddy
Can I go with you?
Oh, daddy
Can I go with you?
Oh, daddy


And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
It's a revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah

So we've been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger
But we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes
Says we can beat this

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
It's a revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah

Tonight we'll stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah


What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing
Would the song still survive without five golden rings
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe
What would happen if God never let it snow
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie
Tell me what would you find

You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

What if angels did not pay attention to
All the things that we wished they would always do
What if happiness came in a cardboard box
Then I think there is something we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away
Tell me what would you find

You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships
Hundred mile an hour lives
And it's this time of year
And everybody's here
It seems the last thing on your mind

Is that the day holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
But here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more

There's gotta be more
There's gotta be more


Please take down the mistletoe
'Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
'Cause everything I want is miles away
Snow covered little town
My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
Season's greetings, hope you're well
Well I'm doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
And everybody's here, except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold

But for me it's just a lonely time
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

Merry Christmas everybody
That'll have to be something I just say this year
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

You were mine


The drought was the very worst, ah ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months, and months of back and forth, ah ah
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
Hung my head, as I lost the war, and the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do, ah ah
When the butterflies turned to dust, they covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof, ah ah
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
I think I am finally clean, ah
Said, I think I am finally clean, ah

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older I won't give in
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst, ah ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
Finally clean, think I'm finally clean, ah ah
Think I'm finally clean


I drive around this town in a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well that's good enough for me

Don't need the real thing
That's just another thing for me to try to tame
Don't know if I could
It might just break me

I thought that for a little while
Every sunset I'd be a riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me

Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough, running free
That's the closest to a cowboy
You'll see me

Before I met him
I was so sane and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window

I learned the dirt roads
And I got my heart broken
'Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go

I thought that for a little while
Every sunset I'd be riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me

Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough, running free
That's the closest to a cowboy
You'll see me

It was all a bit wonderful and strange
But I'll never look at a sunset the same like,

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me

Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough, running free

Sitting fishing by the river bank
Swimming in the water tank
That's the closest you'll see me

Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough, running free
That's the closest to a cowboy
You'll see me


You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel somethin'
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up the walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you, and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing, honey
But I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you
Died for you

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Oh, every smile you fake is so condescending
Countin' all the scars you've made
Now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you


You said it in a simple way,
4 AM, the second day,
How strange that I don't know you at all.
Stumbled through the long goodbye,
One last kiss, then catch your flight,
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself don't get attached,
But in my mind I play it back,
Spinning faster than the plane that took you,

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.

The delicate beginning rush,
The feeling you can know so much,
Without knowing anything at all.
And now that I can put this down,
If I had known what I know now,
I never would have played so nonchalant.

Taxi cabs and busy streets,
That never bring you back to me,
I can't help but wish you took me with you,

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.
I guess you're in London today,
And I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.

This is falling in love in the cruelest way,
This is falling for you and you are worlds away.

New York, be here.
But you're in London and I break down,
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.

This is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
And I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.

I don't wanna miss you like this.
Come back, be here.
Come back, be here.


I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore and I 
know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore

Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far and I
I've got you down
I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start

Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name oh
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I've watched you so long, screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say

But I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore


I've never gone with the wind, just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants
'Til you opened the door, there's so much more
I've never seen it before
I was trying to fly but I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier crazier crazier

I watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes and you made me believe.

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier,crazier,crazier oh

Baby you showed me what livin' is for
I don't wanna hide anymore

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I'm, I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Crazier, crazier


He said, I got me a nice new apartment
In a city, wouldn't you have hated that?
I'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with.
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back,

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

He was lying when he said he moved to L.A.
He's just hiding out on the other side of town
With his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away
He's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying,

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

She almost called him on the night that he wrote
These simple words on his goodbye note

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

In dark blue Tennessee


Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps,
Praying the floor won't fall through, again
My mother accused me of losing my mind,
But I swore I was fine, you paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game,
But you changed the rules every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone
Tonight, well I stopped picking up, and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home, I should've known

Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said "run as fast as you can"

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home

Dear John, I see it all, now it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen is too young
To be played by your dark twisted games, when I loved you so?
I should've known

You are an expert at sorry,
And keeping the lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry
Have tired, lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me,
So don't look now, I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home.

I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known, you should've known
Don't you think I was too young? You should've known


I'm a laid back
T-shirt, blue jean, mood ring
Kinda girl
Hey yeah what's the word on you
Lay low I'm a mission rebel
Angel devil
Little lamb upper mental
Sometimes I get temperamental

But here I am an open book
Turn the page it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

I'm poetry, complicated
Simply stated
Hey yeah baby how about you
I was born free
I'm a cell phone hippie
Are you with me?
When I mess up I don't get up
I just get down yeah

But here I am an open book
Turn the page it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

It's raining on Sunday
There's nothing on TV
Yesterday was lonely
You're the only one who gets me
My mind is like an island
Drifting through the ocean
I can't stop thinking about you
I bet you're thinking of me too

Well here I am an open book
Turn the page it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me
Yeah here I am an open book
Turn the page it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me


She walks to school with her arms crossed
It's just another day-at ten o'clock she hears this screaming
Then finally she sees them
It's scary how things change.

And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried!

Didn't she call you? 
Didn't she need you bad enough?
Was there some reason, another way up?
Did you not write it down, just one more thing to do?
Where were you, didn't she pray too?

He kissed his wife goodbye and took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night to put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle, three men walked and said:
"We're here to die for our God,"
He stood up and said:
"That's funny because my God died for me!"

I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried!

Didn't he call you?
Didn't he need you bad enough?
Was there some reason, another way up?
Did you not write it down, just one more thing to do?
Where were you and didn't he pray too?

The taxis pulled up on the very day of
They road a hundred floors up just to come back down
They never thought they'd see the day the tower's up in flames
There was nothing left to say when it all came down.

And didn't they call you?
Didn't they need you bad enough?
Was there some reason, another way up?
Did you not write it down, just one more thing to do?
Where were you, where were you?
And didn't they pray too? Oh. 

I walk to school and I wear a cross
I'm counting every day.


My mama stood across the room
Face to face but never eye to eye
Recalling words we said
The battle that we swore
We'd never fight

Breaking pieces off with every lie
A tear came to her eye
And she said

Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you block me out tonight
Honey where are you?
And don't hate me for loving you

He walked around my life
And made blind
With every single move
He caught me staring at him
Mad about him

Little that I knew
Love is different
When you play the fool
And all I wanna do is say

Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you make cry tonight
Like you always do
And don't hate me for loving you

I slammed the door
Sat on the floor
Cried into my bed
Said are you there?
Do you even care?
To cross above my head
But someone said

Don't turn away now
And don't rip my heart out
Things are meant to happen like this
I know it's right for you
And don't hate me for loving you

I looked up at the sky
Face to face and finally
Eye to eye


I know you guys have a lot of amazing bands
From this part of the world, did you know that?

Well now he's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in his hair, ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
He walks like summer and talks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to cha ay ange
Ay ay ange
But since his return from the stay on the moon
He listens like spring and he talks like June, ay ay 
Ay Ay 

But tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
That heaven is overrated, tell me
Did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar and did you miss me while you were 
Looking for yourself out there 

Well now he's back from that soul vacation
Chasing his way through the constellation, ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, ay ay ay
Ay ay ay

Well now he's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that he might think of me as 
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man 
Who is too afraid to fly so he never did land 

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance 
Along in the light of day yeah
Head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find and did you miss me while you were 
Looking for yourself out there 

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong can you imagine 
No first dance, freeze dried romance 
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte you have ever had and me

Just tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance 
Along in the light of day yeah
Head back toward the Milky Way
And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar and did you miss me while you were 
Looking for yourself?

Nana nana nana 
Nana nana nana na-ah
Oh oh oh

Nana nana nana 
Nana nana nana na-ah
Oh oh oh

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong can you imagine 
No first dance, freeze dried romance 
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had and me

Thank you so much


There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered "have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks, like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
Two a.m., who do you love?
I wonder till I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, hey
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was, enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that this was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again
These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you


All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago is green eyes and freckles
And your smile in the back of my mind making me feel like
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall painted blue
But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down and open up the door for you

And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies the beautiful kind
Making up for lost time, taking flight, making me feel like

I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you, know you, know you

All I know is we said hello
Your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
All I know is he held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

All I know is we said hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed


Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open

The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score

Keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around), oh they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown) and nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just gotta keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes

Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open (keep your eyes open)

(Keep your ey-eyes open)
(Keep your ey-eyes open)
(Keep your ey-eyes open)

Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping

Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open


Isn't it funny how many times we can say
We drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page
And moved on
That's what we thought

But here I am in the same old car
Having myself another same old brown-eyed bar
Uh oh, uh oh

I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road until the one we're on ends
And we'll tell each other things like "I need you"

You and me
Baby, this is what we do
I may see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
Fall back on you

You always let someone come in between
You're talking around the truth and never say what we mean
Look at all this wasted time

I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friend
We'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end
And we'll tell each other things like "I love you"

You and me
Baby, this is what we do
I may see
There are people who you come back to
So fall back on me, 
Fall back on you

Maybe we'll last
Maybe we won't
Maybe we'll stop talking or talk like girls
But just, baby, get along with me

You and me
Baby, this is what we do
I may see
There are people that you come back to
Fall back on me
Baby, I'll fall back on you
Fall back on me baby,
Baby, I'll fall back on you
Fall back on you

Fall back on you


You say you've turned it off
Hid your heart up on a shelf
Scared of what it might cost
To take it off for someone else
Because loving him, you lost
Too much of yourself
Baby, can't you see that she's not me and . . .

I need you to know you can fall into me
That my arms are wide open
And will always be
Right here waiting, staying strong
Come and fall into me

I'll follow any road anywhere to get to you
I'll open up my soul
If that's what you need me to do
But now, baby, it's your move
All you've got to do
Is believe in love, just believe in us now

I need you to know you can fall into me
That my arms are wide open
And will always be
Right here waiting, staying strong
Come and fall into me

Just believe in love
Just believe in us
Baby . . .

I need you to know you can fall into me
That my arms are wide open
And will always be
Right here waiting, staying strong
Come and fall into me

Come and fall into me
Baby, fall into me


There's somethin' bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah

We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent mindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

So baby drive slow
Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it remember it

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Well you stood there with me in the doorway
my hands shake
I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something, it's fearless.

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless


You take a deep breath
And you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in awhile
Try and stay out of everybody's way

It's your freshman year
And you're gonna be here for the next four years
In this town
Hoping one of those senior boys
Will wink at you and say, "you know I haven't seen you around, before"

'Cause when you're fifteen,
Somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen

Feeling like there's nothing to figure out

Count to ten
Take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
At fifteen

You sit in class next to a red-head named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls
Who they think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon as we can

And then you're on your very first date
And he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And you're mama's waiting up
And you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing around the room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen,
Somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen

And your first kiss makes your head spin around

But in your life you'll do things
Greater than dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted
Was to be wanted
Wish you could go back
And tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen,
Somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen

Don't forget to look before you fall

I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

La la la la la
Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl
And take a deep breath as you walk through the doors


Someone struck a match against the night
All I could see was you and I, I was captivated 
A perfect little dream inside my head
And then reality crept in and erased it.
For a while I thought that I could hold you 
But you were just a temporary high.

Firefly, you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it do you?
I wish I could keep you, firefly, firefly.

Something so beautiful and free
Was as never meant to be caged in
I thought I had you in my hand, I tried to catch you
But I can't chase the wind
And every time I reach out to touch you
I remind myself you were meant to fly.

Firefly, you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it do you?
I wish I could keep you, firefly, firefly.

I'd like to think I'd be all that you wanted
But not even that is enough...

Firefly, you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it do you?
I wish I could keep you, I wish I could keep you firefly, firefly.


Once upon a time, I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me

Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened? Please tell me

'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure

So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence, that cuts me to the core
Where is this going? Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

Oh back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always

And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby,
You said forever and always, yeah.

I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days 
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything 
And everybody believed in you


CHORUS:
It's alright just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent


But some things you can't speak of 
But tonight you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now 
If only you had seen what you know now then
Wasn't it easier in your firefly catching days
When everything out of reach someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild till you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you


CHORUS:
It's alright just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh 
Who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent


It's okay life is a tough crowd
32 and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent


BRIDGE:
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new


CHORUS:
It's alright just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent


It's okay life is a tough crowd
32 and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent


Lost your balance on a tightrope
It's never too late to get it back


Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that.

I don't even know her,
But I feel a responsibility,
To do what's upstanding and right,
It's kinda like a code, yeah,
And you've been getting closer and closer,
And crossing so many lines.

And it would be a fine proposition,
If I was a stupid girl,
But honey I am no-one's exception,
This I have previously learned.

So don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Ah ah, don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
I see you turn off your phone,
And now you got me alone,
And I say, don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

I just wanna make sure,
You understand perfectly,
You're the kind of man who makes me sad,
While she waits up,
You chase down the newest thing,
And take for granted what you have.

And it would be a fine proposition,
If I was a stupid girl,
And yeah I might go with it,
If I hadn't once been just like her.

Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Ah ah, don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
I see you turn off your phone,
And now you've got me alone,
And I say, don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

Call a cab,
Lose my number,
You're about to lose your girl,
Call a cab,
Lose my number,
Let's consider this lesson learned.

Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Ah ah, don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Wanna see you pick up your phone,
And tell her you're coming home,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

It would be a fine proposition,
If I hadn't once been just like her.


My name's Gracie
I'll be five in May
Kinda scared 'cause
I've never been on a plane

My mama says that it'll be alright
'Cause I'm gunna see my daddy tonight
And she says that

There's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
An' I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

My name's Heather
Guess we're on the same flight
Don't mind Gracie
She could talk to you all night

She's finally well enough to travel
Doctor says she's in the clear
She's been in and out of hospital
Since the beginning of the year

And there's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
But none of us want to get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

James T. Johnson
That's her daddy's name
He's been overseas
It'll be a year today

He never talked about being scared over the phone
He just said me and Gracie will come and take him home

There's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

And the people that we meet
As we go through the rain
There are no accidents in what we do


You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and its all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And its comin' over you like its all a big mistake

Holding my breath, won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong, you're all I wanted
Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time I'm wishin' he was you instead
Oh, oh, holding my breath, won't see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong, you're all I wanted
Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

I know, I know, I just know
You're not gone, you can't be gone
No

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong, won't finish what you started
Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it


Here you come again
Just when I've begun
To get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart
Around your little finger
Here you come again
Just when I'm about
To make it work without you

You look into my eyes
And light those dreamy eyes
And pretty soon I'm wondering
How I came to doubt you
All you got to do
Is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you
And in a little while
You're messing up my mind
And filling up my senses

Here you come again
Looking better than a body
Has a right to
And shaking me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again

All you got to do
Is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you
And in a little while
You're messing up my mind
And filling up my senses

Here you come again
Looking better than a body
Has a right to
And shaking me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again
Here I go
And here you come again


Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we would talk
And I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can't help myself

Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I've got some things to say to you
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I've never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving
I think you and I should stay the same

Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can't help myself

They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine

Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else

I can't help myself if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can't help myself
myself
Mm
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Oh, Oh,
Mm
Mm


I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York Time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light "Go"
Yeah, you skipped the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

And darling, it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of 'I need you'
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

Cause darling, it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you

It was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you


I think of you every single evening 
As I lay awake at night
I try to think; try to walk away with you
And I say:

Honey baby, don't do anything crazy around us
Say that everything will be fine
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I want to make you mine?
Because everybody else in the world is driving me crazy 
Except you, honey baby
Oh!

Flying high, I can see his smiling 
As we walk down by the drives
Take my hand, take my breath away
Because you make me feel like flying

Honey baby, don't do anything crazy around us
Say that everything will be fine
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I want to make you mine?
Because everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby
Oh!

Oh, you are everything I'll ever need
Oh, you are everything I want to be
Drive me crazy, have me, baby
All I really want to say is:

Honey baby, don't do anything crazy around us
Say that everything will be fine
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I want to make you mine?
Because everybody else in the world is driving me crazy 
Oh, except you, honey baby


Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know
There's just no getting over you
Hello, I'm just a fool 
Who's willing to sit around and wait for you
But baby, can't you see
There's nothing else for me to do 
I'm hopelessly devoted to you
But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside 
I'm not in my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

My head is saying, "Fool, forget him"
My heart is saying, "Don't let go"
Hold on to the end, that's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you
But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside 
I'm not in my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you


(Oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh)

Stand there like a ghost
Shaking come the rain, rain
She'll open up the door
And say, are you insane, -ane?

Say it's been a long six months (Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want (Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl

And then you say
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait for ever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait for ever and ever

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl

Remind her how it used to be, be
Yeah, with pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tell her how you must've lost your mind (Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
When you left her all alone and never told her why, why (Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)

And that's how it works
That's how you lost the girl

And now you say
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait for ever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait for ever and ever

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, yeah

And you could know, oh
That I don't want you to go

Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me, yeah, yeah

And then you say I want you for worse or for better (Worse or for better)
I would wait for ever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait for ever and ever (I want you for ever and ever)

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
(That's how it works) And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh (Get the girl)

(It's how it works) And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh

And that's how it works
That's how you got the girl


I bet this time of night you're still up.
I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply.
I bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say "Hello" to you
And risk another goodbye.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe.
It's probably better off this way.
And I confess babe,
In my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I wanna try again with you.
And I almost do.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me, not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

I bet this time of night you're still up.
I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me.


Been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls, hoping you'd call
It's just a cruel existence like there's no point hoping at all

Baby, baby, I feel crazy, up all night, all night and every day
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
What is happening to me?

I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

I'm sitting eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life, oh

Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
I gave you something, but you gave me nothing
What is happening to me?

I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit (fit, babe) wherever (wherever)
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
I see you around in all these empty faces
Up all night, all night and every day
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
Now I'm in a cab, I tell 'em where your place is
What is happening to me?

I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
Until you come back home


Wish I had concentrated,
They said love was complicated,
But it's something I just fell into.
And it was overrated,
But just look what I created,
I came out alive, but I'm black and blue.
Before you ask me if I'm alright,
Think about what I,
Had to do, yeah

Wake up and smell the break up,
Fix my heart, put on my make-up,
Another mess I didn't plan.
And I'll bet you thought you beat me,
Wish you could only see,
I got an "I Heart question mark"
Written on the back of my hand!

I'd be fine if you'd just walked by,
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right.
But I can't believe you made me,
Sit at home and cry like a baby,
Wait right by the phone every night.
And now you ask about you and I,
There's no you and I,
Remember what you put me through,
I had to

Wake up and smell the break up,
Fix my heart, put on my make-up,
Another mess I didn't plan.
And I'll bet you thought you beat me,
Wish you could only see
I got an "I Heart question mark"
Written on the back of my hand!

And when you're home all alone at night,
You'll still wonder why
You took everything I had, oh baby.
I haven't thought about you and I,
There's no you and I, and I know
Someday you will

Wake up and smell the break up,
Realize that we won't make up,
It didn't go the way you planned.
And you'll know you didn't beat me
When you look down and see
I got an "I Heart question mark"
Written on the back of my hand!

Written on the back of my hand!
An "I Heart question mark", yeah.
Written on the back of my hand!


Once upon time
A few mistakes ago
I was in your sights
You got me alone
You found me
You found me
You found me

I guess you didn't care
And I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard
You took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies
He'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning

And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt
Is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see
He was long gone
When he met me
And I realize the joke is on me

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

When your saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything
Yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble


I I I I, I I I I
I I I I, I I I I
I I I I, I I I I, I I

You stand with a hand on my waist line (I I I I, I I I I)
Good to see that we're out in blank side (I I I I, I I I I)
I can hear them whisper as we pass by (I I I I, I I I I)
It's a bad sign, bad sign (I I)
Something happens when everybody finds out (I I I I, I I I I)
See the vulture circling in dark cloud (I I I I, I I I I)
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out (I I I I, I I I I)
It could burn out (I I)
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes (I I I I, I I I I)
And guns, they are the hunters, we are the foxes (I I I I, I I I I)
And we run

Baby I know places we won't be found and they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places
I know places

Lights flash on the run for the fences (I I I I, I I I I)
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it (I I I I, I I I I)
Lose sleep, swing ship, all the damn time, not this time (I I I I, I I I I, I I)
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it (I I I I, I I I I)
My love, they are the hunters, we are the foxes (I I I I, I I I I, I I)
And we run

Baby I know places we won't be found and they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love

Baby I know places we won't be found and they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places

(I) They take their shots, we're bulletproof
I know places
(I) And you know for me it's always you
I know places
(I) In the dead of night, you act so great
I know places
(I) And I know for you it's always me
I know places

(I I I I, I I I I)
(I I I I, I I I I)


Ooh baby give me one more chance
(Show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me [back in your heart]
Ooh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms
(I want you back)
I want you back(x4)
Ooh baby
I want you back
(x2)
Ooh
Oh baby give me one more chance
(Show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me [back in your heart]
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms
I want you back
(x2)
Ooh baby


It's 2 A.M. in your car
Windows down, I pass my street
The memories start

You say it's in the past
And drive straight ahead
You think I'm gonna hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live

And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

It's 2 A.M. in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you

We were a crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live

And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore

And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I

You always knew how to push my buttons (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
You give me everything and nothing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
This mad, mad love makes you come rushing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
Stay back where you stood (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)

I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)

2 A.M., here we are
See your face
Hear my voice in the dark

We were a crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live

And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live

And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore

And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
You give me everything and nothing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
This mad, mad love makes you come rushing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
Stand back where you stood (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)

I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would

I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I (I wish you would)


Throwing pennies at the fountain
But when you're standing on the mountain
It's kind of hard to aim
Like the tree we cut our names in
There must be an explanation
Guess it didn't get enough rain
I need reasons why you're leaving

Well I guess I wished on a plane, I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on the paper wasn't really in your heart
Because I swore when you said that you loved me
Guess I heard you wrong

And I guess I wished on a plane, and I thought it was a star


I don't think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes

He'd never fall in love
He swears, as he runs his fingers through his hair
I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
That I know all his favorite songs

And I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful
He has his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him..
I'd lie

He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn't a light go on
Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long

He sees everything in black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine

I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful
He has his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him..
I'd lie

He stands there, then walks away
My God, if I could only say
I'm holding every breath for you

He'd never tell you, but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up is
My God, he's beautiful
So I put on my make-up and pray for a miracle

Yes I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Oh, and it kills me
His sister's beautiful
He has his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him..
If you ask me if I love him..
I'd lie


I'm every women, it's all in me 
Anything you want done, baby I'll do it naturally
I'm every women, it's all in me  
I can read your thoughts right now, every one from A to Z
Oh, oh, oh.

I can cast a spell with secrets you can't tell
Mix a special brew, but fire inside of you
But anytime you feel danger or fear
Instantly I will appear 'cause

I'm every women, it's all in me 
Anything you want done, baby I'll do it naturally
I'm every women, it's all in me  
I can read your thoughts right now, every one from A to Z
Oh, oh, oh.

I can sense your needs like rain onto the seeds
I can make a rhyme of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down to good old fashion love
I've got it, I've got it, I've got it yeah-ah-ah!

I'm every women, it's all in me 
Anything you want done, baby I'll do it naturally
I'm every women, it's all in me  
I can read your thoughts right now, every one from A to Z.

I'm every women, it's all in me 
Anything you want done, baby I'll do it naturally
(Anything you want)
I'm every women, it's all in me  
I can read your thoughts right now, every one from A to Z.

(I'm every women, it's all in me...)


Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
Sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side

And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

Just a small-town boy and girl
Living in the crazy world
Trying to figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do

And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
And only you can tell

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you


Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them,
Now I'm pacing up the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to a night when you said to me,
"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose"

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

If you're out there
If you're somewhere
If you're moving on
I'll be waiting for you
Wary, since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door
And I say

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you say it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby, I don't like the ending
Oh, I thought you'd be here now, whoa
Thought you'd be here by now


I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything?
And everybody believed in you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you'll live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
And everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep?
Before the monsters caught up to you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent

It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty two and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too

Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to
Be brand new

It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent

It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty two and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Lost your balance on a tight rope, oh
It's never too late to get it back


She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by
And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me but if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me but if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

Like shadows in a faded light
Oh we're invisible
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize

I just want to show you, she don't even know you,
Baby let me love you, let me want you".

She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile


(Spoken):
We can step it up just a little bit of a notch. We can step it up I think. And I want you to sing along to every song that I sing that you know, please. As loud as you possibly can, I will not get offended. I think one of the cool things about being able to play guitar is that you can play whatever you want. And uh, you can play songs that you wrote or you can play songs that other people wrote or you can play country songs or you can play, you can play this.

To the left
To the left
Everything you own 
In the box to the left
In the closet
That's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it
Please don't touch

Keep talking and yes that's fine
Could you walk and talk 
At the same time and
It's my name thats on the tag
Come in with your bags
Let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard
Telling me how I'm such a fool
How I'm never going to find a man 
Like you
Got me twisted

You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you
In a minute
Matter of fact
He'll be here in a minute 
Baby
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you
Ever for a second get to thinking

You're irreplaceable

So
Go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick
And see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought
That I didn't know
What'd you think 
I was putting you out for
Because you were untrue
Hauling her around in the truck
That I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standing in the front yard
Telling me how I'm such a fool
Talking about
How I'll never find a man like you
Got me twisted

You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter of fact
He'll be here in a minute
Baby
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second
Get to thinking
You're irreplacable
Yeah


I like the way you sound in the morning,
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound I have ever heard

I like the way I can't keep my focus,
I watch you talk you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is we should be together

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa oh I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me

Baby, I'm never gonna leave you,
Say that you wanna be with me too
Cuz I'ma stay through it all so jump then fall

Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me I love each freckle on your face, oh,
I've never been so wrapped up,
Honey, I like the way you're everything I've ever wanted

I had time to think it all over and all I can say is come closer,
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa oh I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me

Baby, I'm never gonna leave you,
Say that you wanna be with me too
I'ma stay through it all so jump then fall

The bottoms gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees,
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

Whoa oh I need you baby
Don't be afraid please
Jump then fall, jump then fall into me

Baby, I'm never gonna leave you,
Say that you wanna be with me too
I'ma stay through it all so jump then fall

Jump then fall baby
Jump then fall into me, into me

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine
And every time you're here baby, I'll show you, I'll show you
You can jump then fall, jump then fall, jump then fall 
Into me, into me yeah


She didn't have a reason to go, oh no
She didn't have a reason to stay
Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run

And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow

If I could drive all night 
Would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
An unfamiliar exit sign
If I just drive on by
Just south of knowing why

I didn't really know her that well 
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind. 
She felt so out of touch, just felt too much
If you don't know what you want, nothing's ever enough

And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound
That's where I'm headed right now

If I could drive all night 
Would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
An unfamiliar exit sign
If I just drive on by 
Just south of knowing why

I don't have a plan
I don't have a map
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
I don't have a when
And I don't have a where
I don't even know if I'm knowing I'm there

And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow

But If I could drive all night 
Would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
An unfamiliar exit sign
If I just drive on by
Just south of knowing why

I just drive on by
Drive on
Drive on
Drive all night

If I drive on
Drive on
Drive on
Drive all night
Just south of knowing why


Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kiss me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year
Maybe this year I'll give it to someone special

'Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special


I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go
Away
Away

I do recall now
The smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July ninth
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you missed
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember
The swing in your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake
Meetin' my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is that
I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is that
I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last


One daybreak, one heartache, every once upon a time
That black dress, happiness, bubble baths and quarter lines
They mean so much to everyone 
But you count them up one by one
Clear midnights and his father, was thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
A blue body afraid of it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
They're for the little things

Oil paintings and make it, every detail turned out bad
One night stands, new romance, living for that love and person
It means so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one
Clear midnights and his father, was thinking that your dad was ten feet tall

A blue body afraid of it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
They're for the little things, oh, yeah 

No fighting, black riding, wish upon a star and give the moon a smile
Pretending, defending, take a risk and go a thought for the right
Strawberries and fairies with wings
They're for the little things
Na na na, na na na, na na na na, uh yeah
Na na na, na na na, na na na na, oh yeah


I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "this is absurd"
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, "long live the look on your face"
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered


I've got a lying smile, I never put out for you
'Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
And they say little girls have big dreams
And nothing in the word was gonna come between me and you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out
Love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing, it'd be a long time going

They say it's better to have lost, than never to have loved at all
And I say whoever said that didn't have too far to fall
And they say little girls are so naive 
That wasn't how it was supposed to be, with me and you

And it was a long time coming,
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out
Love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing, it'd be a long time going

I burned my bridges, had sleepless nights
Washed my sins on the neon lights
And I'm still not over you

And it was a long time coming,
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out,
Love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing, it'd be a long time going
A long time going
And it would be a long time, long time going
It would be a long time, long time going


I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh!)

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You ask me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you just made me do)
"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now"
"Why?"
"Oh, 'cause she's dead!" (oh!)

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do


We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello

Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, please, don't go

And I said,
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby just say yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me, I was begging you, please, don't go

And I said Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes

Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby just say "Yes"

Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said
"Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby just say yes"

Oh, oh,
Oh, oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you.


There's a little girl in this little town 
With a little too much heart to go around 
Live forever, never say never 
You can do better, that's what she says 

Her mama named her Lucky on a starlit night 
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite of
The fact that she's different and yet she's the same 
And she says do do do do do do do do do do do do do do 
do do do do do do do do 
Lucky you, lucky you 
Do do do do do do do do 

She sings her little song
She walks a long a little 
Pathway headed for the skies 
Left her travels, lives they unravel 
Mind over matter, that's what she says 

Her mama named her Lucky on a starlit night 
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite of
And the fact that she's different and yet she's the same 
And she says do do do do do do do do do do do do 
do do do do do do do do do do do 
Lucky you, lucky you, lucky you 
do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do 

Maybe she'll sing you do do do do
Maybe she'll bring you up to the skies 
Honey, she'll love you 
Funny how some view 
Angels above you ain't so far away. 

Her mama named her Lucky on a starlit night

He's got a nice little life
He's gonna live it, but on
Friday nights he plays that mandolin
Painted red, and he said
It's not the best I know
But it's mine, I'm gonna make it mine

People there can't help but care
About the friendly music of a guy
Who's getting by from their applause
He's got a song that moves along
He's got his local crowd tonight
At Angelina's family bar and grill

He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin

Got a car, got a scar
Like everyone he's got a few but
Everybody loves that mandolin
Got his problems, bills to pay
Somehow that boy finds a way
Through paychecks in tip jars, yeah

He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin

Oh he's the kind of guy
Who never really wanted fame
His feet are planted firmly on the ground
He never wanted people to remember his name
He never wanted word to get around
That he found heaven on earth

He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin
Oh, I'm the guy who plays the mandolin
Mandolin
Oh, mandolin


She said
"I was seven, and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights."
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and fallin' in love
And our mamas smiled, and rolled their eyes
And said, "Oh, my, my, my"

Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up; you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me, and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh, my, my, my, my

Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined, like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled, and rolled their eyes
And said, "Oh, my, my, my"

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two AM, ridin' in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
Slammin' of doors 'stead of kissin' goodnight
You stayed outside till the morning light
Oh, my, my, my, my

A few years had gone and come around
We were sittin' at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came, and our mamas cried
You said, "I do," and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on the very front porch
After all this time, you and I

And I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine in the sky
Oh, my, my, my


I shined your shoes
I poured the wine
I gave you all of my time

I patched your fake smile
Against your friends
Which apparently is a crime

I gave you space
You took my place
And gave it to her

But life's too long 
To waste it all loving a liar

And when love hands me matches now
I'm going to burn it down

I keyed her car
Got my guitar
And wrote this damn song

Look what you've found
She's been around
I hear the line's long

And don't you tell me 
To be nice
I'm not a nice girl

She died from complications
Of the things you told her

So when love hands me matches now
I'm going to burn it down

Ain't it funny
You said honey
You meant sitting duck
Well I say cheater, liar, truck on fire, loser, leaver, deceiver
Just a few I've thought of

And when love hands me matches now
Going to burn it down
I'm going to burn it down
Oh yeah
Going to burn it, burn it, burn it down

Matches, now


You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You, have knocked me off my feet again,
Got me feeling like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails
On a chalk board, calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

You can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down,
Try to block you out 'cause I never impress you
I just want to feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold but the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening, washed up and ranting
About the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean and a liar and pathetic
And alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Yeah someday I'll be big enough
So you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so (mean)
Someday I'll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean)

And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean)
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?


Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of fallin'
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sittin', there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Flash forward, and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

And we got bills to pay
We got nothin' figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

Do you remember, we were sittin' there, by the water?
You put your arm around me, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Oh, oh, oh, oh

And I remember that fight, two-thirty a.m.
'Cause everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye,
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone"

You said, "I remember how we felt, sitting by the water.
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time.
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter.
She is the best thing that's ever been mine."

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Do you believe it?
We're gonna make it now
And I can see it

(I can see it now)


(Spoken):
Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Hilton. Um, I met him a couple months ago doing a show out in California, um, and I had met him because he had said some nice things about me in a magazine and said, "You know, I'm a really big fan of Taylor Swift's music," and I read that and I'm like, wow, that's really cool. So I had my management contact his management and he arranged to come be at one of my shows. And so, you know, I asked him to come out and sing with me. And while he was standing there next to me on stage I said, "Tyler, how would you like to be in one of my music videos?" And uh, the crowd, he was kind of silent but the crowd was like, "Yeah! Oh my God!" You guys know how to do that? That's what I like to hear. Anyways, so he's standing here on stage and I'm like straight up, "Do you want to be in a music video? I'm shooting one in a couple weeks." And, uh, he goes, "Well, I guess. Yeah sure." Because I mean the crowd was going so loud that if he would have said no they would have probably booed him off the stage. Which was kind of my point of asking him on stage. So basically I forced him to be in my music video. Have ya'll seen that one? Would ya'll like me to bring him out and do a song with him? Tyler Hilton's in the house tonight! So, uh, the song I asked to sing with him, um, a couple months ago when we had a show together was one that he sings on One Tree Hill. You see, Tyler is on the show One Tree Hill because he's cool. He was also in the movie Walk The Line, he played Elvis Presley. So I decided to go all out for my hometown. So, uh, Tyler, you going to sing a song with me?

Yeah, let's do it! If you guys know, sing along too.

Taylor:
Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
I'm still standing here
And you're miles away
And I wonder why you left me
And there's a storm that's raging 
Through my frozen heart tonight

Tyler:
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spent my time just thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild
But it's my heart that's begging 
Down this long distance line tonight

Both:
And I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what I might say

Tyler:
There's a message in the wires
And I am sending you a signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
But it's my heart that's breaking down 
This long dusty road of mine

Both:
But I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I aint missing you at all
No matter what my friends say

Taylor:
And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to you or something
I can't bridge this distance
Honey, stop this heartache all alone

Both:
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friends say
I ain't missing you
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
Yeah, no matter what your friends say

Hey yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No

(Spoken):
Good night everybody! Woo! You like that, girls?


I like glitter and sparkly dresses
But I'm not gonna talk about that
In my monologue

I like baking and things that smell like winter
But I'm not gonna talk about that
In my monologue

La La La
La La La

I like writing songs about douchebags who cheat on me
But I'm not gonna say that
In my monologue

I like writing their names in songs so they're ashamed to go in public
But I'm not gonna say that
In my monologue

La La
La La La La La 

This is my musical monologue

You might think I'd bring up Joe
That guy who broke up with me on the phone
But I'm not gonna mention him
In my monologue

Hey Joe, I'm doin' real well
Tonight I'm hosting SNL
But I'm not gonna brag about that
In my monologue

La La La
Ha Ha Ha
Ha Ha Ha
Ha Ha Ha
La La La

And if you're wondering if I might
Be dating the werewolf from Twilight

I'm not gonna comment on that
In my monologue

La La
La La La La La

This is my musical monologue

You might be expecting me to say
Something bad about Kanye
And how he ran up on the stage
And ruined my VMA monologue

But there's nothing more to say
'Cause everything's okay
I've got security lining the stage

This is my SNL monologue

La la
La la la la la

This is my SNL monologue

La la
La la la la la

That was my SNL monologue


I know we've got a lot to say 
Between now and forever
But I'd be a game if you would play, 
And I dare this to get better

So all throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do, is follow you

And if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

Wherever you think I am tonight
Just know we're miles from a heartbreak
Because in the blink of one pretty brown eye
I'll be right where you are baby

Sometime along the way 
You took my breath away
Distracted by the view
I fall right into you

And if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

They say I need to see all the people out there waiting
But you take one look at me
And I know the mistake I'd be making

'Cause if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need my love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

I know we've got a lot to say 
Between now and forever


On a childhood highway through a night alone 
I was barely breathing, I was crawling home 
Well, it's not quite London or the south of France 
Or an Asian island or a second chance 

Going back to Nashville, thinking about the whole thing 
Guess you got to run sometimes 
Maybe I'm a fast train rolling down the mountain 
Watching all my life go by 

You're a distant memory, you're an exit sign 
I was talking crazy on the driver's side 
And I know I hurt you but I won't confess 
Was that blood or a wine stain on your wedding dress? 

Going back to Nashville, thinking about the whole thing 
Guess you gotta run sometimes 
Maybe I'm a fast train rolling down the mountain 
Watching all my life go by 

Going back to Nashville, laughing at a bad break 
What's the use in wondering why? 
Maybe I'm a storm front rolling through the valley 
Tearing up a good July 

And it's safe and warm where nothing ever happens 
Would it be so hard to realign a star or two? 
Change a southern night for you 
Well, it's not quite evening, and it's not New York 

There's a scar in the blue sky by the old airport 
And I'm talking crazy on the driver's side 
I will always love you like a long goodbye


I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

I need you now
Words I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came

My world's a little colder now
But I'm keeping warm somehow

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need, don't need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you?
I don't need you, don't need you now

I need you now
Words I heard you whisper to me
We were walking down a one-way street

You need me now
That's what you've been telling my friends
But I've come too far to go back there again

My heart, my mind and number have changed
You might as well forget my name

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you?
I don't need you, don't need you now

I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And I waited so frustrated
So who's gonna hold you?
I don't need you now

And I don't know where you are
I don't wonder where you are
I don't dream about you  
'cause I don't need you now

I don't dream about the way
That I never heard you say
'I need you, I need you'
I don't need you now

Don't need you
Don't need you now


Your little hands wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in and turn on your favorite nightlight

To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have honey
If you could stay like that

Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
No one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
Never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out
Someday and call your own shots

But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your p.j.s getting ready for school

Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
And no one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up
Oh I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
Could still be little
Oh I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple

Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please try to never grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just never grow up


Look at you
Look at me
Look at who
We could be

I wanna know
Who you are
What you want
From the start

And everytime I look at you
I can hardly say a thing
my head starts to spin
And it hits me then
I love you

And everytime you look at me 
I could go crazy but I don't 
say it but I won't
Cause I'd rather be alone 
Than lose you

And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, nevermind

All the time
Everyday
There's nothing I can do baby
To make it go away

So look at you
And look at me
Now think of who
We could be

And everytime I look at you 
I can hardly say a thing
my head starts to spin
And it hits me then
I love you

And everytime you look at me I could go crazy 
but I don't say it but I won't
Cause I'd rather be alone 
Than lose you

And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, nevermind

All I really wanna say is I need you babe
But how could you understand
What happens if you turn away
And everything turns blue and grey
And I just wish I told you, nevermind

And I could tell you now
But baby nevermind

Yeah
Oh yeah

I could tell you now but nevermind

Yeah 
Oh yeah yeah

And I could tell you now but nevermind


We're all bored
We're all so tired of everything
We wait for
Trains that just aren't coming
We show off
Our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We're so young
But we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb
But we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears
Of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
So get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

We're all here
the lights and boys are blinding
We hang back
It's all in the timing
It's poker
He can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace

We need love
But all we want is danger
We team up
Then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors
Are terrible and cruel
But, honey most of them are true

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come on, come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded, it's so romantic (it's so romantic)

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free


It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes down to my skin
Driving away and I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
There's nothing to say and I
I try to grab at the fray 'cause I, I still love you but I can't!

Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye baby
I want you back but it has come down to nothing
All you have is to walk away from
The one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah.

Picture frame is empty it's black and white
You're smiling down at me
I take your photo off the dash
Back to the conversation we were so sure of everything
Everything we thought we'd always have.
Lost in the sound of it, the here and the now comes and
It seems like I'm becoming part of your past!

Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye baby
I want you back but it has come down to nothing
All you have is to walk away from
The one thing I thought would never leave me.

There's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And I can feel you like you're slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends.

Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye baby
I want you back but it has come down to nothing
All you have is to walk away from
The one thing I thought would never leave me.

Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye baby
I want you back but it has come down to nothing
All you have is to walk away from
The one thing I thought would never leave me
Yeah, if there was one thing I knew would never leave me...

It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes down to my skin.


He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating intoxicating
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you


Oh
We were standing in an empty room
The moonlight was fallin'
You were holdin' my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I coulda spent a life with you
But those days are over
You were callin my name 
When your face faded from view

Wasn't it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day
Wasn't it you that told me?

Angels fly, in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimmin" out on the lake?
Stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night

Oh
I remember waking up with you
The days doin' nothin'
You meant more to me then, than you ever knew
You were gonna be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a nobel seminar
Hope the the world never tore that out of you

Wasn't it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day
Wasn't it you that told me?

Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimmin' out on the lake?
And stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises you made on Our last night?

Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved?
And the songs we played and the indian days
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
Like harold and martin singing

I was waving as you drove away
The sunlight was falling
You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane

Angels fly in the air tonight
Was it just like the promises that we made?
And stars collide in the air so light
Was it just like those promises that you made?
On our last night
On our last night 
Oh,oh,oh,whoa,whoa,yeaah, oh 


I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he said,

Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said,

Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is a slamming screen door
Sneaking out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone, and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late, and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again, oh yeah, oh, oh, yeah

I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song


Elevator buttons and morning air,
Strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs,
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares,
But right now,
My time is theirs.

Seems like there's always
Someone who disapproves,
They'll judge it like they know about me and you,
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do,
The jury's out,
And my choice is you.

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
And life makes love look hard,
The stakes are high,
The waters rough,
But this love is ours,

You never know what people have up their sleeves,
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me,
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles,
But I don't care,
'Cause right now you're mine,
And you say,

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
And life makes love look hard,
The stakes are high,
The water's rough,
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate,
If it's wrong and,
Your hands are tough but they are where,
My belong in,
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you.

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth,
And I love the riddles that you speak,
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored,
'Cause my heart is yours.

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
And life makes love look hard,

And don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
But they can't take what's ours,
They can't take what's ours,
The stakes are high,
The water's rough,
But this love is ours.


Looking at it now
it all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good.

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods

Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)
Ooh your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (we decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good.

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods?

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying baby, I did too
But when the sun came up I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out, I said, I'm setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up you were looking at me

You were looking at me
Oh!
You were looking at me

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods? (I remember)
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (Oh, I remember)

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good


If you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough

I'd like to keep you until I'm old
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, perfect have I loved

Do you remember the stupid things we used to do?
Before September stole me away from you
The time we got your truck stuck in the creek
Because baby, roads weren't wild enough for you and me

Saying:
If you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you until I'm old 
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, perfect have I loved

I used to see you by the bridge we used to cross
I found the feeling of trying to get lost
You would smile that smile that I tried so hard to forget

It's hard to douse a fire that I still haven't put out yet 

And if you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you until I'm old
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, perfect have I loved

Love was all we knew
And faith was growing on the vines
Words were all we had
And for one summer you were mine

Saying:
If you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe, this will be enough
I'd like to keep you until I'm old 
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, perfect have I loved


I know he loved you
A long time ago
I ain't jealous of you
Just thought you should know
You were never good enough for him or anything like me
So you might as well sit back 'cause I ain't tryin to show maturity

CHORUS
X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were makin
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart 
In permanent marker

So I found that picture
Of you in that green dress
Sure had a good time
Cleanin up that mess
He found 30 other pieces but he'll never find 'em all
Tried to tape them back together 
Now he knows to keep it off the wall

CHORUS
X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were makin
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart 
In permanent marker

Well I don't appreciate you callin him to reminisce
The only reason is you're seein just how much better off he is

CHORUS
X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were makin
Who do you think you are
To Write on his heart

CHORUS
X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were makin
Who do you think you are
To Write on his heart
In permanent marker
In permanent marker
Oh 
Permanent marker


State the obvious
I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine!
I'll tell mine
You're gay
By the way

I hate that
Stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burn

There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here
Planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

'Cause I hate that
Stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burn

If you're missing me
You'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health

'Cause I hate that
Stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive

You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying

So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard

I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burn

Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
Just another picture to burn
Baby, burn


Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom
Some, some boys are tryin' too hard
He don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it?

Me, I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist
And we'll move to an island-and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every lover known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
(No one has to know)

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Ooh, are you ready for it?

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
In the middle of the night

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?


Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh red
Burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
Burning red
Burning it was red

Oh losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah red
We're burning red

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street


Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And, I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say sabotage
I never saw it coming, nor would I have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling
And, she thinks I'm psycho
'Cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but
Sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school
So it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but I'll always get the last word
Whoa

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

And do you still feel like you know what you're doing,
'Cause I don't think you do, oh
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
C'mon show me how much better you are
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say sabotage


Elevator buttons and morning air,
Strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs,
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares,
But right now, 
My time is theirs.

Seems like there's always
Someone who disapproves,
They'll judge it like they know about me and you,
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do,
The jury's out,
And my choice is you.

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
And life makes love look hard,
The stakes are high,
The waters rough,
But this love is ours,

You never know what people have up their sleeves,
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me,
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles,
But I don't care,
'Cause right now you're mine,
And you say,

So don't you worry your pretty little mind, 
People throw rocks at things that shine,
And life makes love look hard,
The stakes are high,
The water's rough,
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate,
If it's wrong and,
Your hands are tough but they are where,
My belong in,
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you.

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth,
And I love the riddles that you speak,
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored,
'Cause my heart is yours.

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
And life makes love look hard,

And don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
But they can't take what's ours,
They can't take what's ours,
The stakes are high,
The water's rough,
But this love is ours.


I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong
I got a lump in my throat because you're gonna sing the words wrong


I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor
Plastic dinosaurs, I love you to the moon and back

I remember your blue eyes looking into mine like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand
Little man, from even that moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember the drive home when the blind hope
Turned to crying and screaming, "Why?"
Flowers piled up in the worst way
No one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here

I remember the last day when I kissed your face
I whispered in your ear

Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
Out of this curtained room in this hospital
We'll just disappear
Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand me downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
But what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you

Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back


There's a plane or a bus leaving from Dallas
I hope you're on it
If there's a train moving fast down the tracks
I hope you caught it

Because I swear out there ain't where
You ought to be
So catch a ride or catch a cab
Don't you know that I miss you bad
But don't you walk to me

Baby, run
Cut a path across the blue sky
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby, run
So baby, run

Oh, if you ain't got a suitcase
Get a box
Or an old brown paper sack
Pack it light or pack it heavy
Take a truck, take a Chevy

Baby, just come back
There's a shortcut to the highway out of town
Why don't you take it
Don't let that speed limit slow you down
Go on and break it
Baby, break it

And run
Cut a path across the blue sky
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby, run

Run to me
Baby, run
Run to me
So baby, run
Run
Oh baby, run


Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds in different cities
And time, is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons, and darling they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, this train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, for the life of us we can't get back

A beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful

What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair


I remember tears streaming down your face when I said I'll never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said don't leave me here alone
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes, the sun is going down
You'll be alright, no one can hurt you now
Come morning light, you and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window, darling everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold onto this lullaby even when the musics gone, gone

Just close your eyes, the sun is going down
You'll be alright, no one can hurt you now
Come morning light, you and I'll be safe and sound

Just close your eyes, you'll be alright
Come morning light, you and I'll be safe and sound


Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
I've been an awful good girl, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
Well I'll wait up for you, dear, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the boys I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
I've been an angel all year, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa, honey, there's one more thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine, Santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
And I don't mean on the phone, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight


I stay up too late, got nothing in my brain
That's what people say mmm, that's what people say mm
I go on too many dates, but I can't make 'em stay
At least that's what people say mmm, that's what people say mmm

But I keep cruising, can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music in my body and it's gonna be alright

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

I'll never miss a beat, I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see mmm, that's what they don't see mmm
I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own), I'll make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know mmm, that's what they don't know mmm

But I keep cruising, can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music in my body saying it's gonna be alright

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Hey, hey, hey, just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and dirty, dirty cheats in the world you could have been getting down to this sick beat

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like "oh my God", but I'm just gonna shake it
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby, we can shake, shake, shake

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

Strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything
Is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you
Feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance; it was a moment of weakness
And you said "yes"

You should've said no
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've known that word like what you did with her
Would get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there
In the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be beggin' for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been cryin'
Baby, you know all the right things
To say
But do you, honestly
Expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance; it was a moment of weakness
And you said "yes"

You should've said no
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've known that word like what you did with her
Would get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there
In the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be beggin' for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me

I can't resist
Before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?

No, no
No, no, no, no

You should've said no
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've known that word like what you did with her
Would get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there
In the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be beggin' for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me


Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round young virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing hallelujah
Christ the savior is born
Christ our savior is born

Silent night, holy night
Son of God
Love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Jesus Lord at thy birth

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Christ the savior is born


Let's watch the tide chase the waves onto the sand 
I wonder if a broken heart feel the warmth on my hand 
Don't wonder how a piece of driftwood could see more through his lifetime 
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights 

I've seen a million things 
spoke a million words 
now i only want to speak to you 

Waiting for the words 
counting every bird 
there's nothing i'd rather do 
on smokey black nights 

Still through the haze i can make out constellations 
I'll make one of you and me as we sit in the sand 
And i saw that sunset gleamin as my eyes went wild 
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights 

I've played a thousand songs 
sang a thousand words 
now i only want to sing to you 

Waited on a wire 
starin at the fire 
there's nothing i'd rather do 
on the smokey black nights 

Yeah 

I've walked a thousand miles 
smiled a thousand smiles 
Now I only smile when I'm with you 


Waiting for the words 
counting every bird 
there's nothing i'd rather do 
on the smokey black nights 

So walk with me 
As the sweet wind dances 
I'm writing a song for you and me 
On the smokey black nights


The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far

And you stood there in front of me just
Close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something that'll haunt me whenever you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly, when you smile

My mind forgets to remind me, your a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you, imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know its no good
And I could wait patiently
But I really wish you would

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile

I run my fingers through your hair
And watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
Its just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
And I'm captivated by you baby
Like a fireworks show

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile

When sparks fly oh baby smile
When sparks fly


I am not the kind of girl,
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion,
But you are not the kind of boy,
Who should be marryin' the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends,
And her snotty little family, all dressed in pastel,
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid,
Somewhere back inside a room,
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry,
This is surely not what you thought it would be,
I lose myself in a daydream,
Where I stand and say

"Don't say yes, run away now,
I'll meet you when you're out,
Of the church at the back door,
Don't wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,"
And they said, "Speak now"

Fond gestures are exchanged,
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march,
And I am hiding in the curtains,
It seems I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be,
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen,
But I know you wish it was me,
You wish it was me, don't you?

Don't say yes, run away now,
I'll meet you when you're out,
Of the church at the back door,
Don't wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said, "Speak now"

Don't say yes, run away now,
I'll meet you when you're out,
Of the church at the back door,
Don't wait or say a single vow,
Your time is running out,
And they said, "Speak now"

I hear the preacher say,
"Speak now or forever hold your peace,"
There's a silence, there's my last chance,
I stand up with shaking hands,
All eyes on me,
Horrified looks from everyone in the room,
But I'm only lookin' at you

I am not the kind of girl,
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion,
But you are not the kind of boy,
Who should be marryin' the wrong girl

Don't say yes, run away now,
I'll meet you when you're out,
Of the church at the back door,
Don't wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said, "Speak now"

And you say, "Let's run away now,
I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door,
Oh baby, I didn't say my vow,
So glad you were around when they said, "Speak now"


Days go by, I wonder if you here me
Can't you read between the lines?
Now I'm standing still, I am disappearing
Take this chance, I'll make you mine

Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

He tells lies, are you really thinking
That you deserve another try
When you see these eyes
You see another planet
Don't ask how, but fate decides

Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning and turning
And living and learning
I should be able to handle this
Make it or break it
Move it or shake it
Do it or fake it
Girl you've got to make it

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And all I see is you


I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up late one night at the window,
We were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song he was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, "Look at you, worrying so much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way"
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me,
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

Like "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh ooh he's talking crazy
Ooh ooh dancing with me
Ooh ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?


I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know
Is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon boom
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs
Four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right


Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles; it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home
Saying, does he know
Will you ever know?

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love; don't you know?
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you've looked for
I hope your love leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't, stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say "hey, by the way

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love; don't you know?
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you've looked for
I hope your love leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't, stay beautiful

If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold, at least you'll know

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love; don't you know?
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you've looked for
I hope your love leads you back to my front door
Oh, but if it don't
Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
Na, na, na, na, na


I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away
But you stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said "okay, let's talk."

And I said,
Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
That took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to

Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hangin' out with you, all the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life

Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is going to love me, when I get mad, mad mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay


Let me know how's it feel 
To be under my skin 
Wrapped around my heart 
Is it like anywhere you've been? 
And everything I do I do it just for you 

So why the hell don't you love me? 
Why the hell don't you need me 
Like I need you?
Are you so far above me? 
Don't you know there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy 
That's what you destroyed 
Stupid Boy 

I have been looking in 
Tryin' to read your mind 
Give you the benefit of the doubt 
Every single time 
But didn't you walk right by 
I'm screamin' out inside 

So why the hell don't you love me? 
Why the hell don't you need me? 
Like I need you 
Why are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?

But I was just a toy 
That's what you destroyed 
Stupid Boy 

What happens when you wake up 
And see what you've lost 
Take one look at me 'cause 
That's what it cost 
I was gonna be everything you need 
Cause you are everything to me 

So why the hell won't you love me? 
Why the hell won't you need me? 
Like I need you 
Why are you so far above me? 
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy 
That's what you destroyed 
Stupid Boy 

Let me know how's it feel 
To be under my skin


Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
The end of you, oh,
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch it go round and round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl fate and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

So it goes, he can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home, lights are off he's taking off his coat (Hm yeah)
I say "I've heard that you've been out and about with some other girl"
(Some other girl)
He says "What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you and I."
I said "I've been there too a few times"

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl fate and a tight little skirt (A tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go (We never go) out of style, we never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah just take me home, oh

(Out of style) You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style


Tall dark and Superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
Hes got his mothers eyes, his fathers ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
And I know every word that you say, yay
You smile and say, "How are you?"
And I'll say, "Just fine"
I always forget to tell you,
I love you, I love you, forever

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Talk dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's so irrational
But I hope someday you take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep browns eyes has me singin'
He's not as bad like this reputation
I can't hear one single word they said, no
You really got places to be and I'll be old then
I always forget to tell you I love you,
I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't take some other girl
I hope you don't forget about me
I'm far away but I'll never let you go
I'm lovestruck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you

'Cause I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today to save the world
I'll be around forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

La, la, la

When you come back down


This is wrong but
I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face

And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar

Good morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today you'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face I'd be
Counting down the ways to see you
And you smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar
Sweet, sweet superstar
Superstar


Tire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
Whistle County creek
Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass
Baby, you were watching me
Cold barn struck bed, everything you said
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
Just like the two of us
Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
Guess I loved you way too much
But I'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder
But it's still soft enough to cry
Because I remember those times

I remember . . .

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Saw you just the other day
All that I could think to say was
"Hey, how have you been?"
You caught me with that old smile
Said, "It's really been a while
And I still think about back when . . ."

We used to get high on the first kiss
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and now I'm someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Oh, that's what I learned from you
That's what I learned from you, oh you, oh
That's what I learned from you, oh yeah


Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you hear is "no"
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and I, I, I, I

Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh eh
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

And there you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
Your eyes' wider than distance
This life's sweeter than fiction

Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're onto something, I, I, I say

What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

And there you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
Your eyes' wider than distance
This life's sweeter than fiction

There you'll stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes' wider than distance
This life's sweeter than fiction, fiction

I'll be one of the many saying,
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I'll be one of the many saying,
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
I'll be one of the many saying,
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I'll be one of the many saying,
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud

And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when, when you

Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was "no"
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever (forever)

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
Your eyes' wider than distance
This life's sweeter than fiction

There you'll stand next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes' wider than distance
This life's sweeter than fiction, fiction

It's sweeter than fiction
It's sweeter, yeah
It's sweeter than, sweeter
Sweeter than fiction


Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it is just so funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe
Get some sleep tonight

Because he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see


I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me then you cut me down

And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Well I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh

I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around

And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

Why, do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside
Why, do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind

Well I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in

You ask me for my love then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why
Why, tell me why

I take a step back, let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know


You were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldn't have
You were country lovin' really somethin' for three months and a half

Everybody said that you were bad news
But baby I was betting on you

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

I said let them say we're crazy, you said let's go fishing a lot
The midnight moon was blazing baby, I was gazing into your eyes

Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

Can't believe the time you lost me
Can't believe what it cost me

Cause I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big ol serving to pay back
I had to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
You ain't never been through that
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack


I said I know
He said I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this
and I watched him go
He watched me crash to the floor
On my knees just like that

He said when can I come back
I said, that's when, when I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or stormin'
Laughing when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when I never see your face
I let you in, baby that's when

I said I know
He said I did you wrong, made mistakes
Put you through all of this
'Cause I let you go, you let me think
That I'd be fine without you
Imagine that!
So baby when can I come back?
And I said, that's when, when I wake up in the morning
That's when , when it's sunny or stormin'
Laughing when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when I never see your face
I let you in, baby that's when
And I said all this playing
Did you ever think of me?
And he said

that's when, when I woke up in the morning
that's when, when it's sunny or stormin'
Laughing when I was crying,
and that's when you were waiting at the front gate
that's when, when I saw youR fAce
You let me in, and baby that's when

that's when ooooooh. ooh oh ooh oh oh
I said I know
he said I need some time, need some space





I'm five years old
It's getting cold
I've got my big coat on

I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch
And the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs
And fall asleep on the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how
My friends could be so mean
I come home crying
And you hold me tight
And grab the keys

And we drive and drive
Until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop
'Till I forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing
On the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out he's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house
And I had space to run and I
had the best days with you

There is a video I found
From back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
And you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships
And the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now I know why the all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side
Even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine and

I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today.


Find myself at your door,
Just like all those times before,
I'm not sure how I got there,
All roads they lead me here

I imagine you are home,
In your room, all alone,
And you open your eyes into mine,
And everything feels better,

Right before your eyes,
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why,
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

You find yourself at my door,
Just like all those times before,
You wear your best apology,
But I was there to watch you leave,

And all the times I let you in,
Just for you to go again,
Disappear when you come back,
Everything is better

Right before your eyes,
I'm aching, no past
Nowhere to hide,
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong,
This is the last time I say it's been you all along,
This is the last time I let you in my door,
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore

Oh, oh, oh,

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

This is the last time I'm asking you this (this is the last time I'm asking you this)
Put my name at the top of your list (put my name on the top of your list)
This is the last time I'm asking you why (this is the last time I'm asking you why)
You break my heart in the blink of an eye (You break my heart)

This is the last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you this

This is the last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you this

This is the last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you this

This is the last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you this


New to town with a made up name in the Angel city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties' queen

Another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh

Now it's big black cars, and Riviera views,
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page

And they tell you that you're lucky
But you're so confused,
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere,
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square,
And it took some time, but I understand it now

'Cause now my name is up in lights,
But I think you got it right,

Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh

Yeah they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, oh, oh


You should've been there,
Should've burst through the door,
With that 'baby I'm right here' smile,
And it would've felt like,
A million little shining stars had just aligned,
And I would've been so happy.

Christmas lights glisten,
I've got my eye on the door,
Just waiting for you to walk in,
But the time is ticking,
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory,
How you said you'd be here,
You said you'd be here.

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all laughing,
As I'm looking around the room,
But there was one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

And the hours pass by,
Now I just wanna be alone,
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong,
So they follow me down the hall,
And there in the bathroom,
I try not to fall apart,
And the sinking feeling starts,
As I say hopelessly,
"He said he'd be here."

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all laughing,
And asking me about you,
But there was one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do when the one
Who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should've been here.
And I would've been so happy.

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all standing around me singing
"Happy birthday to you",
But there was one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

Ooh, I knew.
Ooh,

You called me later,
And said, "I'm sorry, I didn't make it,"
And I said, "I'm sorry too,"
And that was the moment I knew.


In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said, 'This time I've had enough'
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up
'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride, sitting here alone
Going through the photographs
Staring at the phone
I keep going back over, things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread
So babe if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
That when I left I wanted you to chase after me

Yeah, I said leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, 'there's nothing you can say
To make this right again'
I mean it, I mean it, what I mean I

I said leave but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, wish it weren't this mess
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you


I didn't know what I would find
When I went lookin' for a reason I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothin' seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
And I can still see you; this ain't the best view
On the outside, lookin' in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late, so you see
You could have helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too late to do anything

How could I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
And I can still see you; this ain't the best view
On the outside, lookin' in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh, yeah

How can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
And I can still see you; this ain't the best view
On the outside, lookin' in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh, oh
Oh, oh,
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh


I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
People would say, "they're the lucky ones"

I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fall out
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up I can't break through

Now I'm standing alone In a crowded room
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now next chapter

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes
And trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should have held me
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you'd say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now, the end


If I could escape 
I would, but first of all let me say 
I must apologize for acting, stinking, treating you this way
Because I've been acting like sour milk that fell on the floor 
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator 
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold 

If I could escape 
And recreate a place as my own world 
And I could be your favorite girl 
Forever, perfectly together 
Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? 

If I could be sweet 
I know I've been a real bad girl 
I didn't mean for you to get hurt 
(Forever) We can make it better 
Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? 
(Sweet escape)

(I want to get away
To our sweet escape
I want to get away
Yeah)

You let me down 
I'm at my lowest boiling point 
Come help me out 
I need to get me out of this joint 
Come on, let's bounce 
Counting on you to turn me around 
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground 

So, baby, times getting a little crazy 
I've been getting a little lazy 
Waiting for you to come save me 
I can see that you're angry 
By the way the you treat me 
Hopefully you don't leave me 
Want to take you with me 

If I could escape 
And recreate a place as my own world 
And I could be your favorite girl 
Forever, perfectly together 
Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? 

If I could be sweet 
I know I've been a real bad girl 
I didn't mean for you to get hurt 
(Forever) We can make it better 
Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? 
(Sweet escape)

(If I could escape
If I could escape)

Because I've been acting like sour milk that fell on the floor 
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator 
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold 

If I could escape 
And recreate a place in my own world 
And I could be your favorite girl 
Forever, perfectly together 
Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? 

If I could be sweet 
I know I've been a real bad girl 
I didn't mean for you to get hurt 
(Forever) We can make it better 
Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape)

(I want to get away
To our sweet escape
I want to get away
Yeah)


He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating intoxicating
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you


Beneath the chandelier of star and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows open up
The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound
It's like I'm melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move 
and

Tell me 
You'll never leave me 
that I'm not crazy
and this is really happening 
That this is really happening

Could this be better?
You write me letters 
though you see me everyday
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights 
It really blows me away 

Lock me up in a dark room
And I still can't take my eyes off you 

Tell me 
You'll never leave me 
and I'm not crazy and
This is really happening 
That this is really happening

All those kisses up against your car 
For all those wishes on planes 
We thought were stars
Memories like photographs 
Oh baby, here we are

Tell me 
You'll never leave me 
and I'm not crazy and
Oh and this is really happening 
That this is really happening
Oh,Oh,Baby 

Tell me 
You'll always need me 
That I drive you crazy
And this is really happening
Oh, that this is really happening

Tell me, Oh
You'll always need me 
(need me ,tell me)
(Baby)
That I drive you crazy
(Oh)
That this is really happening


Clear blue water
High tide, came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on
And I will, scars grow darker, currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
In silent screams, and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good
This love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh
Oh, oh

Tossing, turning, struggle through the night for someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lanterns burning, flickered in the mind only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone,
Been losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up, just in time

This love is good
This love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh

This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love

Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young, just to run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good
This love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And, this love came back to me, oh

(This love) This love that's a permanent mark
(This love) This love is glowing in the dark, oh
(This love) These hands had to let it go free
(This love) And this love came back to me, oh

This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love (This love came back to me, oh)


I'm like eight foot four, blond hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore

No I ain't got a gun
No I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents
But I'm still a thug

I'm so gangsta you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing, well I just baked Caramel Delights
T Swift and T Pain rappin' on the same track
It's a thug story tell me can you get with that

I had a dream last night I had high-top Nikes
I had diamonds in my mouth, and diamonds on my mic
By the time I woke I was singing "I'm on a boat"

'Cause I'm a singer turned rapper
Shorty I'm a make ya
Straight to the top, yo
Shorty I'ma take ya

You can call me T Sweezy now I'm a rap star
Hey it's a thug story now tell them who you are

Singer turned gangsta
You don't wanna fight me
Straight to the top
In my extra small white tee

T Swift and T Pain all up on the same track
It's a thug story tell now can you get with that

What! what! I knit sweaters yo!
What! what! don't test me

Hey hold on, hold on I didn't even say anything
What? I said "yo"
Yo, you guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
I didn't even swear
She didn't even swear
Hello?  Ugh!


Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true 'cause I know you

Hold on, baby; you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go, and no one knows
That you cry; but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're givin' it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay

Hold on, baby; you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go, and no one knows
That you cry; but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

Hold on, baby; you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go, and no one knows
That you cry; but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

You're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh
Goodbye, baby
With a smile, baby, baby


Do you remember the day
I leaned up against your car
And it started rolling down the street
You screamed and ran after it
And tried to open the door
And it ran over your foot
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
Because they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
Because that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
And you said it reminded you of me
And I threw the remote at you
And you said, "My point exactly"
And later on that night, under the neon city lights
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
Because they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
Because that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

You call me lucky because I lose everything
But I swear I'd be careful with it
If you gave me a ring

And it would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
Because they don't play our song
I wish that pretty girls wouldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
Because that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along
Until Brad Pitt comes along
Yeah, oh, oh
Until Brad Pitt comes along


He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said: "That's a lie."
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On back roads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer had gone

But when you think "Tim McGraw"
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think "that little black dress"
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

But when you think "Tim McGraw"
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think "that little black dress"
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read

Is when you think "Tim McGraw"
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think "that little black dress"
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

Oh, think of me
Mmm

You said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie."


Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down whenever you're around

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile that takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothin' made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down whenever you're around
Yeah yeah

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Oh oh yeah yeah oh
Today was a fairytale


The lies are always better left unsaid
So take the photos down of the wall
There's nothing left to talk about
We're in a plane and I want out
From all these stories that people tell
Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
I guess it feels worse
Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
I guess it feels worse
When you have to pretend you lose the person that you were in life
When you're trying to fix, you never feel ecstatic and alive
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Now you know exactly how I feel
The truth is out and I can see what's real
There's nothing left to talk about
We're in a scene and I want out
From all these stories that people tell
Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
I guess it feels worse
Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
I guess it feels worse
When you have to pretend you lose the person that you were in life
When you're trying to fix, you never feel ecstatic and alive
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Tonight is our last night alone dear
When you have to pretend you lose the person that you were in life
When you're trying to fix, you never feel ecstatic and alive
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night 



Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away,
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow,
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, and get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I I, I, I I, I, I

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, and get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it


I remember what you wore on our first date
You came into my life
And I thought hey
You know this could be something
'Cause everything you do and words you say
You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing

So maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
Well maybe two is better than one
There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two, is better than one

I remember every look upon your face,
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
I'm finally now believin'

And maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
Well maybe two is better than one
There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two, is better than one



I remember what you wore on the first date
You came into my life
And I thought hey

Maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
Maybe two is better than one
There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking

Oooh I can't live without you
'Cause baby two is better than one
There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And I've figured out with all that's said and done
Two, is better than one

Two is better than one


You had my heart, we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines but you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
That's when you need me there, with you I'll always share

Because when the sun shines we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay
Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

Just trying to get your attention


Untouchable like
A distant diamond sky

I'm reaching out
And I just
Can't tell you why

I'm caught up in you
I'm caught up in you

Untouchable burning
Brighter than the sun
And when you're close
I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like
A million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of heaven

It's half full
And I won't wait here
All day
I know you're saying
That you'd be here
Anyway

But you're
Untouchable burning
Brighter than the sun
Now that you're close
I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like
A million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta, come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on

In the middle of the night
Wakin' from this dream
I wanna feel you
By my side
Standing next to me
You gotta, come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of heaven

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
I'm caught
Up in you
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

It's your
Untouchable burning
Brighter than the sun
Now that you're close
I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like
A million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Oh, oh

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like
A million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta, come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Come on

In the middle of the night
We can form this dream
I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me
You gotta, come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of heaven


If you had only gotten to me first
If I could write a book on how this hurts
You could see the way your smile looks to me

If I wasn't scared of the world alone
If I didn't know he loves me so
If I could only find the strength to leave
You would be with me, so baby

Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go, I hope you think of me

As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging, wait for me

It's so wrong that all I wanna do
Is forget it all and just be with you
I have to go 'cause he don't know
But the writing's on the wall

But here we are in so deep
Soaking wet
Jumping in without no safety net
And I don't know what kinda ropes
Would break this kinda fall, so baby

Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go, I hope you think of me

As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait, wait for me

We can't be together right now
Guess there's no use in trying
But if you look at me right now
Can you tell that I'm dying
To hold you?
But it would be wrong to

So don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go, I hope you think of me

As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging, wait for me

Don't you look now
Don't you look now
I might fall in love
Don't you look now


I remember when we broke up, the first time
Saying, this is it, I've had enough
'Cause like we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you, said you, needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you

Oh we called it off again last night
But oh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever, ever getting back together
We are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together

Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you, would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Oh, you called me up again tonight
But oh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever, ever getting back together
We, are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
But, we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh oh oh

I used to think that we were forever ever, ever
And I used to say, never say never
Huh, so he calls me up and he's like, I still love you
And I'm like I just I mean this is exhausting, you know, like
We are never getting back together like, ever

(No!) We are never ever, ever getting back together
We, are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we, are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, are not getting back together,
We oh, not getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together


We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be back when we had all night
And we were happy.

I do recall a good while back we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it
And we were happy.

When it was good baby, it was good baby
We showed 'em all up, no one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark talkin' bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
We were happy.

We used to watch the sun go down 
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder
Because we were happy.

When it was good baby, it was good baby
We showed 'em all up, no one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark talkin' bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
We were happy.

Oh I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices, that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy
We were happy.

When it was good baby, it was good baby
We showed 'em all up, no one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark talkin' bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
And we were happy, yeah we were happy.
Oh, oh. We were happy.


I got a little thing I call self control
'Cause I get a little crazy 
When I let too much go
Love's a little messy and you are too
Right now I'm scared of both of you
I laugh and I play and I wasn't gonna stray 
Swore I'd never let a man in my way

You're the last thing I needed today

And I don't know 
Where I lost control
And couldn't take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can't win so I give in 
The more I fight it just get's stronger
You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction

Gone and spilled my coffee 
Tryna get to the phone
'Cause it might be you
You just never know
Can't talk to my friends 
Without you coming up
It's even kind of cute 
The way you cuss
I wrote your name down 
A hundred thousand times
'Cause it looks so good 
Right next to mine

You're the last thing I needed tonight

And I don't know 
Where I lost control
And couldn't take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can't win so I give in 
The more I fight it just get's stronger
You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction

I'm acting like a girl 
With nothing to lose
When did I stop caring 
About anything but you

And I don't know 
Where I lost control
And couldn't take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can't win so I give in 
The more I fight it just get's stronger
You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction

Welcome distraction, welcome distraction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction oh oh


Walkin' through a crowd, the village is a glow
Kaleidoscope of a loud, hide beats under coats
Everybody here wanted somethin' more
Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts and put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York (New York!)
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything

Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright but they never blind me
Welcome to New York
New soundtrack
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York
The lights are so bright but they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright, they never blind me
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York


I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh!)

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You ask me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you just made me do)
"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now"
"Why?"
"Oh, 'cause she's dead!" (oh!)

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do


It's this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were going to make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
Because I know that you're living a lie
That's okay baby, because in time you will find . . .

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't want to hurt anymore
And you tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, goes around
Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no, no 

You're not sorry, oh no, no, no

And every time you call him
You spend your nights alone
And he never comes home
And every time you call him
All you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out
That he's doing to you
What you did to me
Girl, you got what you deserved


Shes looking in the mirror
The moments getting nearer
She thinks about it as she walks her walk
Up and down the staircase
Makeup fresh on her face
She thinks about it as she talks her talk
School dance, first chance, always been a dreamer
Theres one guy, shes shy, sees him through the mirror
And everybody looks at her,
She thinks about it

Blue dress angel face, looking in the mirror,
Shoes,purse, hair tied back and you should see her,
Shes got her magic, floating through the air,


Peace,Love,One thing leads into another
Dream big,Aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wonderin' what to wear

She's standing in her bedroom
He'll be pullin' up soon
She thinks about it as she sees headlights
Looking out the window she's got her diary to show
That she's been waiting for this all her life
First date,can't wait
Lookin' in the mirror
Heart all wrapped up
Wait until he sees her
He's lookin' right at her
She thinks about it

Sixteen blue jeans Abercrombie t-shirt
Shoes purse hair tied back and you should see her
She's got her magic floating through the air

Peace, Love,One thing leads into another
Dream big, Aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wonderin' what to wear

The years went by
The mirror saw her cry
She got up again
She got up again
The wind blew by the small town lights
She got up again

Move out
Find out where the world can take her
Bright lights late nights livin' for the greater
Move to Paris livin' on a prayer

Peace, Love,One thing leads into another
Dream big, Aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wonderin' what to wear
Ooo Ooo
Wonderin' what to wear


I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
So may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white


Say you're sorry
That face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on
The days drag on
Stupid girl,
I should have known, I should have known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you
And your white horse, to come around

Maybe I was naive,
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings
Now I know

I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you
And your white horse, to come around

And there you are on your knees,
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And its too late for you and your white horse
Now its too late for you and your white horse, to catch me now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now
Oh, it's too late
To catch me now


You walk in here with your guitar, man
Your shiny boots and your full-on band
A smile on your face, a knife in your hand
Singing songs you got to memorize
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your hands

Don't worry yourself, I ain't your competition
Don't flatter yourself, that was never my intention

I want to talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you in an empty room
And who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be
And who I've always been

I walk in here with a beat-up case
The same guitar I've always played
And the words I wrote down on a page
When I was twelve years old and small town raised
You tell the crowd you're paying dues
I'd tell them this is what I do
And it's what I put my life into
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume

They say life on music row is rough conditions
Oh, but the easy ride was never my ambition

I want to talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you in an empty room
And who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be
And who I've always been

Let's talk about your childhood days
You were the prom queen, I was on this stage
So where's that crown gotten you these days?
When it's me and you and the same damn games
So what've you got that I ain't?
And what do you do that I can't?
Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be, girl
And who I've always been


He said let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city
Away from the crowds
I thought heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall, and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins my one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams (Ah ah)
Wildest dreams (Ah ah)

I said no one has to know what we do
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now
He's so tall, and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
But my last request is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams (Ah ah) (Ah ah)
Wildest dreams (Ah ah)

You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burn it down
Some day when you leave me
I bet these memories hunt you around
You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burn it down (Burn it down)
Some day when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around (Follow you around)

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just pretend

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just (Just pretend, just pretend) in your wildest dreams (Ah ah)
In your wildest dreams (Ah ah)
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams (Ah ah)
In your wildest dreams (Ah ah)


Flashing lights and we, took a wrong turn and we
Fell down the rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
Spinning out of control
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds
Ooh didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should've slept with one eye opened at night

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better, eh
In wonderland, eh
In wonderland, eh
In wonderland, eh
In wonderland

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Didn't you call my fears with the treacherous cat's smile
Ooh didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games, still somebody loses their mind

Oh darling, we found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better, eh
In wonderland, eh
In wonderland, eh
In wonderland, eh
(In won-) In wonderland

I reach for you
But you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad

Oh, we found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh (Last forever)
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better, eh (Never better)
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (Wonderland)
And we pretended it could last forever, eh (In wonderland)
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (Wonderland)
And life was never worse but never better

In wonderland


I can't believe you did it again, walked by and took my heart with you
Why'd you have to look so good? 
Don't you know I'm trying to hate you?
Trying to have a dream without you in it
But how can I put out this fire when you're the one who lit it?

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
Until I do, I'll keep writing songs about you.

I've got a stack of papers so high and it's all about you, baby
Keep thinking maybe I can make sense of something crazy
Something I can't get out of my head
I write your name, I write your name 
Then I tear it all to shreds!

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
Until I do, I'll keep writing songs about you.

And if you ever change your mind and want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me why I shouldn't let you in.

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay 'cause I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
'Til I do I'll just wait for the day that I stop pretending that
I'm really okay when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
'Til I do, I'll keep writing songs about you.


One look, dark room
Men just for you
Time moved too fast
You played it back
Buttons on a coat
Light hearted joke
No proof not much
But you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight, the light reflects
The chain on your neck
He says look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
You felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out,
You are in love, true love
You are in love

Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word
And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kissed on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says, you're my best friend
And you knew what it was, he is in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love

So it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, go round and round
And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
You understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life try to put it into words

'Cause you can hear in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love
You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love


You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room
It's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do'

But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you can see I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey isn't this easy

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say your fine
I know you better then that
Hey what you doing with a girl like that

She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with me

Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong
I think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time
How could you not know
Baby you belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me


You did it.  I can't believe you did it.
Why were you so blind?

You brought her to my party.
Did you think my friends wouldn't know?
Did you think I wouldn't care?

You asked if it was okay.
I didn't know what to say.
I lied.  What is left of today?

You did it.  I can't believe you did it.
Why were you so blind?

You still don't understand.
Why was I so hurt?  
We were just friends you say.
But no more.

You did it.  I can't believe you did it.
Why were you so blind?

She did me a favor when 
calling you on the phone.
She started the ball a-rolling when you 
didn't follow up.  That best friend of hers 
put the ball in play.

You did it.  I can't believe you did it.
Why were you so blind?

I'm free. Lesson learned.  
Cleansed from your curse.  Places 
I no longer want to be.

Now you're going backwards.
No more my life to share.
A mistake you're sure to repeat.
Not my problem now.

You did it.  I can't believe you did it.
What action should I take?
Turn the cheek?  More hurt to bear?

She did me a favor.  Now I'm free
Lesson learned.  Cleansed from 
your curse.  No more in your life to be.


I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh!)

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You ask me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you just made me do)
"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now"
"Why?"
"Oh, 'cause she's dead!" (oh!)

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do


You dont have to call me 
And say your sorry
I'm already gone

you dont have to call me
and break my heart each time
I try moving on

You dont have to call anymore oh yeah
You dont have to call baby


[Instrumental]


All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taking me this long
Baby but I figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no no, no no

Looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no no

You're not sorry, no no

You had me crawling for you honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw there's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before you're not sorry
No, no, no

You're not sorry, no no (no)


I bet you lie awake at night trying to make up your sweet mind 
wonderin if you'll ever find just what you want 
a hometown number one 
or a california loaded gun
but you you'll only get one 
ohh thats what you thought 
and heres what you got

i could be your baby blue jeans 
with the holes in the knees
in the bottom of the top drawer 
i could be a little beauty queen just a little out of reach 
or the girl living next door
i'll be your angel giving up her wings 
if thats what you need 
i'd give everything to be your anyhting 
be your anything

if you want hard to get 
if you want (laugh)
all you have to do is let me know
if you want a bumby ride 
or someone with a softer side 
either one will be alright 
just let me know
cause this is how it goes 

i could be your baby blue jeans 
with the holes in the knees

in the bottom of the top drawer 
i could be a little beauty queen just a little out of reach 
or the girl living next door
i'll be your angel giving up her wings 
if thats what you need 
i'd give everything to be your anyhting 

it's not like i'm giving up who i am for you
but with someone like you it's so easy to do
and 

i could be your baby blue jeans 
with the holes in the knees
in the bottom of the top drawer 
i could be a little beauty queen just a little out of reach 
or the girl living next door
i'll be your angel giving up her wings 
if thats what you need 
thats what you need 

i could be your baby blue jeans 
with the holes in the knees
in the bottom of the top drawer 
i could be a little beauty queen just a little out of reach 
or the girl living next door
i'll be your angel giving up her wings 
if thats what you need 
i'd give everything to be your anyhting 



i heard a song tonight on the radio
another girl sings about a boy
she sees his face in every space, every room
and i know that if i turn around you won't be there
if i close my eyes will you be there?

[chorus]
i don't wanna lose your face
i don't wanna wake up one day
and not remember what time erased
and i don't wanna turn around
cause i'm not scared of 
what love gave me and took away
and i don't wanna lose your face

i've got a picture of you in my bedroom
and i hope it never falls
i hope i never lose that feelin'
i used to get when you called
and i wonder to myself
who were you? where are you? were you ever here at all?

[chorus]
i don't wanna lose your face
i don't wanna wake up one day
and not remember what time erased
and i don't wanna turn around
cause i'm not scared of 
what love gave me and took away
and i don't wanna lose your face

that girl in the song had it so good
i wish i could close my eyes and see you
i wish the sky had your face 
and the oceans has your eyes
and the sun that had your lips
and i had you, ohhhh yeah

[chorus]
i don't wanna lose your face
i don't wanna wake up one day
and not remember what time erased
and i don't wanna turn around
cause i'm not scared of 
what love gave me and took away
and i don't wanna lose your face
ohhh, no, no

i don't wanna lose your face
i don't wanna turn around
oh oh oh oh, yeah
oh, oh, ohhhh
oh, oh, ohhhh
oh, oh, ohhhh yeah

I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh

I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on


It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I'll find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight

Owww!
So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I'll find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright...

All I've got is a picture of you
Now that you've gone and left me blue
You don't hear me cry at night
And say sweet things to you
You don't hear me sing a love song to
A picture of you

I pretend that you're still here with me
Laughing just the way we used to be
But pictures they can't talk and they can't see
I know I'm in love and nothing more
Nothing more

I hope you'll be happy where you are
But if you need me I won't be to far
Standing in the shadow of my dreams
They say it's not as bad as it may seem
But they don't lie awake at night and cry the way I do
They don't realise that all I got
Is a picture of you


Well, if your hands start a-clappin' 
And your fingers start a-poppin' 
And your feet start a-movin' around 
And if you start to swing and sway 

When the band starts to play 
A real cool way out sound 
And if you get to can't help it and you can't sit down 
You feel like you gotta move around 

You get a shot of rhythm and blues. 
With just a little rock and roll on the side 
Just for good measure. 
Get a pair of dancin' shoes 

Well, with your lover by your side 
Don't you know you're gonna have a rockin' time, see'mon! 
Don't you worry 'bout a thing 
If you start to dance and sing 

And chills come up on you 
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too 
Well, here's something for you to do 

Get a shot of rhythm and blues 
With just a little rock and roll on the side 
Just for good measure 
Get a pair of dancin' shoes 

Well, with your lover by your side 
Don't you know you're gonna have a rockin' time, see'mon! 
Don't you worry 'bout a thing 
If you start to dance and sing 

And chills come up on you 
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too 
Well, here's something for you to do 

Get a shot of rhythm and blues 
Get a pair of dancin' shoes 
Get a shot of rhythm and blues 
Well, with your lover by your side 

Don't you know you're gonna have a rockin' time, see'mon! 
Don't you worry 'bout a thing 
If you start to dance and sing 
And chills come up on you 

And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too 
Well, here's something for you to do 
Well, here's something for you to do 
Well, here's something for you to do


A taste of honey,
Tasting much sweeter than wine

Do do do
Do do do

I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey, a taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine

I will return, yes I will return,
I'll come back for the honey and you

Do do do
Do do do

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, 'though we're far apart,
That taste of honey, a taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine

I will return, yes I will return,
I'll come back (he'll come back)
For the honey (for the honey)
And you


You never give me your money
You only give me your paper
And in the middle of negotiations you break down
I never give you my number
I only give my situation
And in the middle of investigation I break down

Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But, oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go

One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Yes it did (na, na, na)

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to heaven

Ah
Here comes the Sun King
Here comes the Sun King
Everybody's laughing
Everybody's happy
Here comes the Sun King

Quando paramucho mi amore defelice corazon 
Mundo pararazzi mi amore chicka ferdy parasol 
Cuesto obrigado tanta mucho que can eat it carousel

Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark, trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy him some clothes
Keeps a ten bob note up his nose
Such a dirty old man

His sister Pam works in the shop
She doesn't stop; she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Well, you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking, but she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag
Dressed in her polythene bag
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl
Who makes the News Of The World
Yes, you could say that she's attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

(John) She's coming in the house
(Paul) Oh, look out!
She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
By the banks of her own lagoon
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though I thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
Although she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me 
Oh, yeah

Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep, pretty darling; do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep, pretty darling; do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Boy, you're going to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're going to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

I never give you my pillow
I only give you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down

Boy, you're going to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're going to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

Oh yeah!
All right!
Are you going to be in my dreams tonight?

Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you

And, in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make

Her majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say
Her majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she changes from day to day
I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I got to get a bellyful of wine
Her majesty's a real nice girl
Someday I'm going to make her mine
Oh yeah, someday I'm going to make her mine


Words are flowing out like
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Jai Guru Deva, om.
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva


They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally

Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally

We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And beggin' down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsal
All I gotta do is act naturally

Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally

Sunrise doesn't last all morning, 
A cloudburst doesn't last all day. 
Seems my love is up 
And has left you with no warning.
It's not always been this grey. 

All things must pass, 
All things must pass away. 

Sunset doesn't last all evening, 
A mind can blow those clouds away. 
After all this my love is up 
And must be leaving. 
It has not always been this grey. 

All things must pass, 
All things must pass away. 

All things must pass 
None of life's strings can last. 
So I must be on my way, 
Face another day. 

Darkness only stays at nighttime, 
In the morning it will fade away. 
Daylight is good 
At arriving at the right time. 
It's not always 
Will to be this grey. 

All things must pass, 
All things must pass away. 
All things must pass, 
All things must pass away.

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy
Nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy

All you need is love, all you need is love
All you need is love, love, love is all you need

All you need is love
All you need is love, love, love is all you need

There's nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
There's nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy

All you need is love, all you need is love
All you need is love, love, love is all you need
All you need is love (All together now)
All you need is love (Everybody)
All you need is love, love, love is all you need

Yesterday
Oh yeah
(She love you, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(She love you, yeah, yeah, yeah)


I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too
I love her

She gives my everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her

A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her


You tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me, you don't get me

You say you've seen seven wonders and your bird is green
But you can't see me, you can't see me

When your prized possessions start to weigh you down
Look in my direction, I'll be round, I'll be round

When your bird is broken, will it bring you down?
You may be awoken, I'll be round, I'll be round

You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me, you can't hear me


Anna,
You come and ask me, girl,
To set you free, girl,
You say he loves you more than me,
So I will set you free,
Go with him.
Go with him.

Anna,
Girl, before you go now,
I want you to know, now,
That I still love you so,
But if he loves you mo',
Go with him.

All of my life,
I've been searchin' for a girl
To love me like I love you.
Oh, now, but every girl I've ever had,
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad.
What am I, what am I supposed to do.

Anna,
Just one more thing, girl.
You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free,
Go with him.

Anna,
Girl, before you go now,
I want you to know, now,
That I still love you so,
But if he loves you mo',
Go with him.

All of my life,
I've been searchin' for a girl
To love me like I love you.
Oh, now, but every girl I've ever had,
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad.
What am I, what am I supposed to do.


For I have got another girl, another girl
You're making me say that I've got nobody but you
But as from today well I've got somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

For I have got another girl, another girl
She's sweeter than all the girls and I've met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do
And so I'm telling you this time you'd better stop

For I have got another girl
Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend

I don't want to say that I've been unhappy with you
But as from today, well I've seen somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

For I have got another girl
Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend

For I have got another girl
Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend
For I have got another girl


[Instrumental]


Any time at all, any time at all, any time at all, all
You've gotta do is call and I'll be there.
If you need somebody to love, just look into my eyes, I'll
Be there to make you feel right.
If you're feeling sorry and sad, I'd really sympathize.
Don't you be sad, just call me tonight.
Any time at all, any time at all, any time at all , all
You've gotta do is call and I'll be there.
If the sun has faded away, I'll try to make it shine,
There's nothing I won't do
If you need a shoulder to cry on I hope it will be mine.
Call me tonight, and I'll come to you.
Any time at all, any time at all, any time at all , all
You've gotta do is call and I'll be there.
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there.


I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know.
And it's true that it really only goes to show,
That I know,
That I, I, I, I should never, never, never be blue.

Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry.
And in time, you'll understand the reason why,
If I cry,
It's not because I'm sad, but you're the only love that I've ever had.

I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more misery.

Ask me why, I'll say I love you,
And I'm always thinking of you.

I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know.
And it's true that it really only goes to show,
That I know,

That I, I, I, I should never, never, never be blue.

Ask me why, I'll say I love you,
And I'm always thinking of you.

I can't believe it's happened to me.
I can't conceive of any more misery.

Ask me why, I'll say I love you,
And I'm always thinking of you.


It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
It's not the way you kiss that tears my apart

But how many many many nights go by
I sit alone at home and cry over you
What can I do, can't help myself
'Cause baby it's you, baby it's you

You should hear what they say about you  (cheat, cheat)
They say, they say you never never ever been true  (cheat, cheat)

Wo ho, it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, then it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
'Cause baby it's you, baby it's you

Wo ho, it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, then it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
'Cause baby it's you
Baby it's you, don't leave me all alone


How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be
And have you traveled very far
Far as the eye can see

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
How often have you been there
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there
Nothing that doesn't show

Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
Inside a zoo, what a thing to do
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man, too

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
Tuned to a natural E
Happy to be that way
Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play

Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
Inside a zoo, what a thing to do
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man, too


Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

She thinks of him
And so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back
She's dressed in black

Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

I think of her
But she only thinks of him
And though it's only a whim
She thinks of him

Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

Oh how long it will take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

She thinks of him
And so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back
She's dressed in black

Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?


Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man, I had a dreadful flight
I'm back in the USSR
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the USSR, yeah

Been away so long I early knew the place
Gee, it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone
I'm back in the USSR
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the US
Back in the US
Back in the USSR

Come and keep your comrade warm

Back in the USSR
Oh, let me tell you honey


A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right just sitting down and look so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts chewing gum in little girl's hair
Man, junior, behave yourself

Buy every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well, he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well, this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now junior, behave yourself

Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
He took your canary and he fed it to the neighbors cat
He gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundromat
Well, mama's head has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now junior, behave yourself


If you ever leave me I'll be sad and blue
Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you 

The birds in the sky would be sad and lonely
If they knew that I'd lost my one and only 
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me 

The leaves on the trees would be softly sighin
If they heard from the breeze that you left me cryin'
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me 

But I know you won't leave me 'cos you told me so 
And I've no intention of letting you go
Just as long as you let me know you won't be bad to me

So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely
'Cause they know that I got my one and only
They'll be glad you're not bad to me



I'm Ringo and I play the drums
Hey, I'm Paul and I play the, uh, bass
I'm George and I play a guitar
I'm John and I too play the guitar, and sometimes I play the fool


Because the world is round it turns me on
Because the world is round, ah

Because the wind is high it blows my mind
Because the wind is high, ah

Love is old, love is new
Love is all, love is you

Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue, ah

Ah


For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques Fair-what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

The celebrated Mr. K.
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishops Gate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite fly's through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten summer sets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill

You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird singing in the dead of night

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

If it takes me all night and day

Well come into my machine 
So we can move on out
I know a jumping little joint 
Where we can jump and shout
It's not too far back on the highway 
Not too long a ride
You take your car along 
And you park it outside 
A little cutie takes your hat 
And you can thank her, ma'am
'Cause every time you're gonna drive 
You find the joint is jammed

Oh Carol, don't let him 
Steal your heart away
Well I've got to learn to dance

Like the boys all play
Hold tight, tap your foot

Don't let the heat overcome you 
'Cause they play so loud 
While the music will treat you 
When they get a crowd
Well you can dance 
I know you will, you thought
I got my eyes on you baby
'Cause you dance so good
Don't let him 
Steal your heart away
I've got to learn to dance 
If it takes me all night and day 
Well I've got to learn to dance 
If it takes you all night and day

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better.

The King of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the Queen
The Queen was in the parlor
Playing piano for the children of the King.

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better.
So cry baby cry.

The King was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The Queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the children's holiday.

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better.
So cry baby cry.

The Dutchess of Kircaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The Duke was having problems
With a message at the local Bird and Bee.

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better.
So cry baby cry.

At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark.

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better.
So cry baby cry cry cry cry baby
Make your mother sigh.

She's old enough to know better
Cry baby cry
Cry cry cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better.
So cry baby cry.


Way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away
That's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay

Way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away-hey
Whoa, that's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay

I'm a still a-longin' for the old plantation,
Oh, for the old folks at home

Ah-oh-oh!

Oh, my my!

Well, way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away-hey.
Whoa, that's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay.

All up and down the whole creation,
Sadly I roam.
I'm still a-longin' for the old plantation,
And for the old folks at home.

All the world is sad and dreary,
Ev'rywhere I roam
Oh, darkies, how my heart grows weary,
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home


Crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back
I just can't seem to get you off my mind
Crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back
You're the one I love, I think about you all the time

Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play
Dear Prudence, greet the brand new day
The sun is up, the sky is blue
It's beautiful and so are you

She's got the devil in her heart
But her eyes they tantalize
She's gonna tear your heart apart
Oh her lips they really thrill me

I'll take my chances
For romance is
So important to me
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me

She's got the devil in her heart
No, no, this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No, no nay will she deceive

I can't believe that she'll ever ever go
Not when she hugs and says she loves me so
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
Listen can't you see

She's got the devil in her heart
Oh, no, no, no, this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No no nay will she deceive

Don't take chances if your romance is
So important to you
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me

She's got the devil in her heart
Oh, no, no, no, no this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No, no nay will she deceive

She's got the devil in her heart
No she's an angel sent to me
She's got the devil in her heart
No she's an angel sent to me

Since she's been gone I want no one to talk to me.
It's not the same but I'm to blame, it's plain to see.

So go away, leave me alone, don't bother me.
I can't believe that she would leave me on my own.
It's just not right when every night I'm all alone.

I've got no time for you right now, don't bother me.
I know I'll never be the same if I don't get her back again.
Because I know she'll always be the only girl for me.

But 'till she's here please don't come near, just stay away.
I'll let you know when she's come home.
Until that day

Don't come around, leave me alone, don't bother me.
I've got no time for you right now, don't bother me.
I know I'll never be the same if I don't get her back again.
Because I know she'll always be the only girl for me.

But 'till she's here please don't come near, just stay away.
I'll let you know when she's come home.
Until that day

Don't come around, leave me alone, don't bother me.
Don't bother me.
Don't bother me.
Don't bother me.
Don't bother me.


You never wear a stitch of lace
And powder's never on your face
You're always wearing jeans except on Sunday
Oh please don't ever change
No don't you ever change

I kinda like you just the way you are
You don't know the latest dance
But when it's time to make romance
Your kisses let me know you're not a tomboy
So please don't ever change
No don't you ever change

Oh promise me you're always gonna be
As sweet as you are
I love you when you're happy
I love you when you're blue
I love you when you're mad at me
So how can I get tired of you?

A lot of other girls I've seen
They know how to treat guys mean
But you would rather die than ever hurt me
So please don't ever change
No don't you ever change

No promise me you're always gonna be
As sweet as you are


Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

Nobody ever loved me like she does
Oh, she does, yeah, she does
And if somebody loved me like she do me
Oh, she do me, yes, she does

Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

I'm in love for the first time
Don't you know it's gonna last
It's a love that lasts forever
It's a love that had no past

Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

And from the first time that she really done me
Oh, she done me, she done me good
I guess nobody ever really done me
Oh, she done me, she done me good

Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down


I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear
On my old front door
I don't hear it,
Does it mean you don't love me anymore?

I hear the clock a'ticking,
On the mantel shelf
See the hands a'moving,
But I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight,
And why I'm by myself
I don't see you,
Does it mean you don't love me anymore?

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so,
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry

I'm sorry that I doubted you,
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash,
And you lost your hair
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two
I said, "That's alright, I'm waiting here,
Just waiting to hear from you"

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so,
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so,
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry


Down in Eastern Australia
I met her
She was wearing a red blue sweater

She said never mind

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?


When I'm walking beside her
People tell me I'm lucky
Yes, I know I'm a lucky guy
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her
Can't stop thinking about her now

Every little thing she does,
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does,
She does for me, oooh
When I'm with her I'm happy
Just to know that she loves me
Yes, I know that she loves me now

There is one thing I'm sure of,
I will love her forever
For I know love will never die

Every little thing she does,
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does,
She does for me, ooh
Every little thing she does,
She does for me, yeah

And you know the things she does,
She does for me, ooh
Every little thing
Every little thing

Well, they took some honey from a tree 
Dressed it up and they called it me 
Everybody's trying to be my baby 
Everybody's trying to be my baby 
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
Well, half past nine, half past four 
Fifty women knocking on my door 
Everybody's trying to be my baby 
Everybody's trying to be my baby 
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
Went out last night, I didn't stay late 
Before I got home I had nineteen dates 
Everybody's trying to be my baby 
Everybody's trying to be my baby 
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
Went out last night, I didn't stay late 
Before I got home I had nineteen dates 
Well, they took some honey from a tree

Everybody's trying to be my baby 
Everybody's trying to be my baby 
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now


I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong.

See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door
I'm painting my room in the colourful way

And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong.

Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
She doesn't need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!


Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do

I want you in the morning, girl, I love you
I want you at the moment I feel blue
I'm living every moment, girl, for you

(Walk, walk cat, walk)
(Go, Johnny, go)
(Same old tale of blues)
(Elmo James got nothing on this, baby)

I've loved you from the moment, I saw you
You looked at me that's all you had to do
I feel it now, I hope you feel it too

Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do
I really love you


Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

La, la, la, la
Home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly
As a bird on wings

Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much
It always made me feel so

Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

La, la, la, la
Home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly
As a bird on wings

Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Always made me feel so free

Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Free

If there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do
Just call on me and I'll send it along

Like a heart that's oh so true

And keep you by my side
I've got lips that long to kiss you
And keep you satisfied (oh)

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back Jojo, go home

Get back, get back
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Back to where you once belonged
Get back Jo

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back Loretta, go home

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back, get back

It's getting better all the time

I used to get mad at my school (No, I can't complain)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool (No, I can't complain)
You're holding me down
Turning me round
Filling me up with your rules

I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better
Since you've been mine

Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can

I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better
Since you've been mine

Getting so much better all the time!

It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better
It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better

I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can (ooh)

I admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
Yes, I admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better
Since you've been mine

Getting so much better all the time!

It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better
It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better

Getting so much better all the time!


Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl
You want so much, it makes you sorry
Still you don't regret a single day
Ah, girl, girl

When I think of all the times
I tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her
After all this time I don't know why
Ah, girl, girl

She's the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there
You feel a fool
When you say she's looking good
She acts as if it's understood
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh
Girl, girl, girl

Was she told when she was young
That pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back
To earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?
Ah, girl, girl, girl
Ah, girl, girl

One little kiss from you
And I feel glad all over
Oo baby, hot dang gilly

I told you about strawberry fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well here's another place you can go
Where everything flows.

Looking through the bent-backed tulips
To see how the other half live
Looking through a glass onion.

I told you about the walrus and me, man
You know we're as close as can be, man
Well here's another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul.

Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah
Looking through the glass onion

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Looking through the glass onion.

I told you about the fool on the hill
I tell you man he's living there still
Well here's another place you can be
Listen to me.

Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dove-tail joint, yeah
Looking through a glass onion.


Here comes the sun king

Quando paramucho mi amore defelice corazon

Once there was a way,
To get back homeward.

Once there was a way
To get back home.

Sleep, pretty darling,
Dot not cry
And I will sing a lullaby.

Golden slumbers,
Fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling
Do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby.

Once there was a way
To get back homeward

Once there was a way
To get back home

Sleep, pretty darling
Do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby.


Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine.
I need to laugh, and when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about,
I feel good, in a special way.
I'm in love and it's a sunny day.

Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine.
We take a walk, the sun is shining down,
Burns my feet as they touch the ground.

Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine.
And then we lie, beneath a shady tree,
I love her and she's loving me.
She feels good, she knows she's looking fine.
I'm so proud to know that she is mine.

Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine.
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine.


Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day how's your boy been
Nothing to do it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Good morning, good morning

Going to work don't want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own you're in the street
Good morning, good morning

After a while you start to smile now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Good morning, good morning

People running round it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town is getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and meet the wife
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear
Go to a show you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Good morning, good morning


Now it's time to say good night
Good night sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Good night good night everybody
Evberybody everywhere
Good night.


Please don't wake me up too late
Tomorrow comes and I will not be late
Late today when it becomes
Tomorrow I
Will leave and go away

Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
My love, goodbye

Songs that linger on my lips
Excite me now and linger on my mind
Leave your flowers at my door
I leave them for
The one who waits behind

Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
My love, goodbye

Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
My love, goodbye

Far away my lover sings
A lonely song and calls me to his side
Where the sound of lonely drums
Invited me on
I must be by his side

Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
My love, goodbye

Goodbye
Ah, ha, ha, hi
Goodbye


I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didn't run, you didn't hide
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day
Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day


Let me tell you about a girl I know
She's my baby and I love her so
Every morning when the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah I just love her so

When I call her on the telephone
She says: baby, I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
She'll be knocking on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
She says: baby everything is alright
That's why I know, that's why I know
Hallelujah I just love her so
Hallelujah I just love her so
Hallelujah I just love that chick so


She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do, oh yeah

She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand like a lizard on a window pane.

The man in the crowd with the multi-colored mirrors on his hobnail boots.

Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime.

A soap impression of his wife which he ate and donated to the National Trust.

I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down

Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun

Happiness is a warm gun (bang bang shoot shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, mama (bang bang shoot shoot)
When I hold you in my arms (oh, yeah)
And I feel my finger on your trigger (oh, yeah)
I know nobody can do me no harm (oh, yeah)
Because, (happiness) is a warm gun, mama (bang bang shoot shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, yes it is (bang bang shoot shoot)

Happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun
Happiness (bang bang shoot shoot)

Well don't you know that happiness (happiness) is a warm gun, (is a warm gun, yeah).

Hello little girl
Hello little girl
Hello little girl

When I see you everyday
I say, "Mm mm hello little girl"
When you're passing on your way
I say, "Mm mm hello little girl"
When I see you passing by
I cry, "Mm mm hello little girl"
When I try to catch your eye
I cry, "Mm mm hello little girl"

I send you flowers but you don't care
You never seem to see me standing there
I often wonder what you're thinking of
I hope it's me and love love love

So I hope there'll come a day
When you'll say, "Mm you're my little girl"

It's not the first time that it's happened to me,
It's been a long lonely time
And it's funny funny to see that I'm about to lose my mind mind mind

So I hope there'll come a day
When you say, "Mm mm
You're my little girl, mm mm mm
You're my little girl, mm mm mm"
You're my little girl, oh yeah
You're my little girl

Do do do do do


You say "Yes", I say "No".

Oh no.

I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello.

I say "High", you say "Low".
You say "Why?" And I say "I don't know".
Oh no.
You say "Goodbye" and I say "Hello, hello, hello".

I don't know why you say "Goodbye", I say "Hello".

(Hello, goodbye, hello, goodbye. Hello, goodbye. Hello, goodbye.)
Why, why, why, why, why, why, do you
Say "Goodbye, goodbye, bye, bye".
Oh no.
You say "Goodbye" and I say "Hello, hello, hello".
I don't know why you say "Goodbye", I say "Hello, hello, hello".
I don't know why you say "Goodbye", I say "Hello".

You say "Yes", I say "No".
(I say "Yes", but I may mean "No").
You say "Stop", I say "Go, go, go".
(I can stay still it's time to go).
Oh, oh no.

You say "Goodbye" and I say "Hello, hello, hello".
I don't know why you say "Goodbye", I say "Hello, hello, hello".
I don't know why you say "Goodbye", I say "Hello, hello, hello".

Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, you know I need someone, help

When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me, get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me, get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me

When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me, get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me, help me, help me, oh


When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again

Do, don't you want me to love you
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on tell me the answer
Well, you may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter

Will you, won't you want me to make you
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

Look out
Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter
Look out, 'cause here she comes

When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
And I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
And I get to the bottom and I see you again, yeah, yeah

Well do you, don't you want me to make you
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me your answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

Look out
Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter

Look out, helter skelter
She's coming down fast
Yes, she is
Yes, she is
Coming down fast

(I've got blisters on my fingers)


Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl,
But she doesn't have a lot to say
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she changes from day to day

I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a bellyful of wine
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
Someday I'm going to make her mine, oh yeah,
Someday I'm going to make her mine.


Here comes the sun (doo doo doo doo)
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
It's all right


To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching their eyes and hoping I'm always there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching their eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere


Sheepdog, standing in the rain
Bullfrog, doing it again
Some kind of happiness is
Measured out in miles
What makes you think you're
Something special when you smile

Childlike no one understands
Jackknife in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is
Measured out in years
You don't know what it's like
To listen to your fears

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me

Big man (yeah) walking in the park
Wigwam frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is
Measured out in you
You think you know me, but you haven't got a clue

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me

Hey hey

Quiet, quiet (ok)

Hey, Jude, don't make it bad,
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey, Jude, don't be afraid,
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain,
Hey, Jude, refrain,
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Da da da da da da da da da.
Hey, Jude, don't let me down,
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
You're waiting for someone to perform with.
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude you'll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

Da da da da da da da da da.
Hey, Jude, don't make it bad,
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better
Better, better, better, better wowwww
Hey Jude
Na na na na na na
Na na Hey Jude...

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now she's hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what I'd say

Honey pie, you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home

Oh honey pie, my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee

Oh honey pie, you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me

Honey pie, you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home


How do you do 
What you do to me?
I wish I knew 
If I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you
How do you do 
What you do to me?
I'm feeling blue 
Wish I knew how you do it to me 
But I haven't a clue 
You give me a feeling in my heart
Like an arrow piercing through it 
I suppose that you think you're very smart
But won't you tell me how do you do it? 
How do you do 
What you do to me?
I wish I knew 
If I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you
You give me a feeling in my heart 
Like an arrow piercing through it 
I suppose that you think you're very smart
But won't you tell me how do you do it? 
How do you do 
What you do to me?
I wish I knew 
Wish I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you 
Wish I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you
Wish I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you 


I am he as you are he as you are me
And we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun
See how they fly
I'm crying

Sitting on a corn flake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation T-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man you've been a naughty boy
You let your face grow long

I am the egg man
They are the egg men
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob

Mr. City policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky
See how they run
I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying

Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl
You let your knickers down

I am the egg man
They are the egg men
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob

Sitting in an English garden
Waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come you get a tan
From standing in the English rain

I am the egg man (How do you do sir?)
They are the egg men (The man maintains a fortune)
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob, goo goo goo g'joob

Expert, texpert choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you (Ho ho ho, hee hee hee, hah hah hah)
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide
I'm crying

Semolina Pilchard
Climbing up the Eiffel tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allen Poe

Goo goo g'joob, goo goo goo g'joob, goo goo


I call your name but you're not there
Was I to blame for being unfair
Oh, I can't sleep at night
Since you've been gone
I never weep at night
I can't go on

Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not going to make it
I'm not that kind of man

Oh, I can't sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name

Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not going to make it
I'm not that kind of man

Oh, I can't sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name
I call your name
I call your name

I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone please let me know

I've had a drink or two and I don't care,
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her I'll be glad
I still love her

I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone please let me know

I still love her
If I find her I'll be glad
I still love her

I've had a drink or two and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

(Kesler/Feathers)

I forgot to remember to forget her
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her
But I've found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time

Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
'cause I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget

Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
'cause I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget.

(Berry)

I'm gonna search this town
From door to door
The love I crave
I can't find no more

I got to find my baby
I declare there ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

You know I hate to see the sun
Sinking to the west
'cause I know my whole life's
Gonna be one solid mess

I got to find my baby
I declare there ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

Well ever since the day
That she said we were through
I've been nervous
And shook up too

I got to find my baby
I declare there ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

Well I don't care if the last thing
I ever done in my life
Is to find that little woman
Make her my wife

I got to find my baby
I declare there ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye.


(Wilkin/Westberry)

Well you call me your baby
When you hold in my hand
But the way that you hurt me
I just don't understand

Well you say that you need me
Like an ocean needs sand
But the way you deceive me
I just don't understand

Well you know that I love you
More than anyone can
But a one-sided love
I just don't understand

Well you know that I love you
More than anyone can
But a one-sided love
I just don't understand

Well you call me your baby
When you hold in my hand
Oh how you can hurt me
I just don't understand.

And never leave you.
Please come on back to me.

Said you had a thing or two to tell me.
How was I to know
You would upset me?
I didn't realize
As I looked in your eyes
You told me, oh yes, you told me you don't want my lovin' anymore.
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this
I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you,

Well she was just seventeen
You know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another,
Oh, when I saw her standing there

Well she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
Oh, when I saw her standing there

Well my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Oh, when I saw her standing there

Well my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Oh, when I saw her standing there
Oh, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well since I saw her standing there


I should have known better with a girl like you,
That I would love everything that you do; and I do,
Hey, hey, hey, and I do.

Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be,
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see

That when I tell you that I love you, oh,
You're gonna say you love me too,
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, oh
And when I ask you to be mine,

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words they seem to slip away

When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's all right
I'll make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things
I want to tell you
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell
Maybe you'd understand

Who knows how long I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me to-- I will.

For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same.

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart.

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will.


You know, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again

I love you so, oh
I'm the one who wants you
Yes I'm the one who wants you
Oh, ho, oh, ho, oh

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

I thought that you would realize
That if I run away from you
That you would want me to
But I got a big surprise
Oh, ho, oh, ho, oh

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

I want to go,
But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you
Oh, ho, oh, ho

You, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again


The sun is fading away
That's the end of the day
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

Just one kiss and I'll go
Don't hide the tears that don't show
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

To where the winds don't blow
And golden rivers flow
This way will I go

They were right, I was wrong
True love didn't last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way, hey
To where the winds don't blow
And golden rivers flow
This way will I go

They were right, I was wrong
True love didn't last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way, hey

I'll be on my way, oh, oh
I'll be on my way, oh, oh
I'll be on my way


I've got every reason on earth to be mad
'Cause I just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't, so I'll cry instead

I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger that my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't, so I'll cry instead

Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away
But I'll come back again someday

And when you do you'd better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two
And show you what your lovin' man can do
Until then I'll cry instead


One day, you'll look
To see I've gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun
One day, you'll know
I was the one
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know
Oh-oh-oh
One day, you'll find
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know
Oh-oh-oh
One day, you'll find
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun


Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Imagine I'm in love with you
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many, many, many times before

It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end
Oh yeah, oh yeah

I think about you night and day
I need you and it's true
When I think about you I can say
I'm never, never, never, never blue

So I'm telling you my friend
That I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Well, there's gonna be a time
When I'm gonna change your mind
So you might as well resign yourself to me, oh yeah

Imagine I'm in love with you
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many, many, many times before

It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, whoa yeah


I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won, and have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry?

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be


You tell lies thinking I can't see
You can't cry 'cause you're laughing at me
I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down

Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same old thing happens everyday
I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down

We're all alone and there's nobody else
You still moan, "Keep your hands to yourself!"
I'm down (I'm really down)
Oh baby, I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down, wow

Baby I'm down (I'm really down)
Well, baby I'm down (I'm really down)
Well, baby, baby, baby (I'm really down)
Oh baby, I'm down

And if you ever say goodbye
And if you ever even try

So they'll know exactly
Just what I'm gonna do

If you ever say goodbye
And if you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you.


Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you, too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

I don't wanna kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just wanna dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

Just to dance with you
Is everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you, too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

Just to dance with you
Is everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you, too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
I discovered I'm in love with you
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you


I'm looking through you, where did you go 
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You don't look different, but you have changed 
I'm looking through you, you're not the same 

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right? 
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight 

You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, any other way

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right? 
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight 

I'm looking through you, where did you go 
I thought I knew you, what did I know 
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same


When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)

Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (There's no need)

Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping

Ooh yeah

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)

Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping


I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no

I'm so tired, I don't know what to do
I'm so tired, my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do

You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid get

You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

Oh no, oh no, oh no.
Yeah, I've got a feeling, yeah.

All these years I've been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.

I've got a feeling, that keeps me on my toes
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

I've got a feeling, I think that everybody knows
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I've got a feeling, yeah.

Ev'rybody pulled their socks up,
Ev'rybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

A feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

I've got a feeling, a feeling I can't hide
Oh no
Oh no no no

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I've just seen a face,
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met.
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mm-mm-mm-m'mm-mm

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware.
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

I have never known
The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, di-di-di-di'n'di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

Yeah!
Bup-a-lup-bup!

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

I've just seen a face,
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met.
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mm-mm-mm-di-di-di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.


If I fell in love with you 
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand?
Because I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands
If I give my heart to you
I must be sure from the very start
That you would love me more than her
If I trust in you, oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh please 
Don't hurt my pride like her
Because I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain
So I hope you see
That I would love to love you
And that she will cry when she learns we are two
Because I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain
So I hope you see
That I would love to love you
And that she will cry when she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you


If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah


If you leave me, baby
I don't know what I'll do
I guess I would die, sweetheart
If I don't get a kiss from you

Take out some insurance on me, baby
Take out some insurance on me, baby
Well, if you ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna go right home and die

Oh, if you want me, baby
You've gotta come to me
Mm, I'm just like a stump in a field
You just can't move me

Take out some insurance on me, baby
Ooh, some insurance on me, baby
Well, if you ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna go right home and die

Well, if you want me, baby
Mm, you've gotta come to me
I'm just like a stump in a field
You just can't move me

Well, if you want me, baby
Mm, you've gotta come to me
I'm just like a stump in a field
You just can't move me

Well, if you leave me, baby
I don't know what I'll do
I guess I would die, sweetheart
If I don't get a kiss from you

Take out some insurance on me, baby
Mm, some god damned insurance on me, baby
If you ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna go right home and die




If you've got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me
You're quite content to be bad 
With all the vantage you had over me
Just cause your trouble 
And don't bring your troubles to me
I don't think it's funny 
When you ask for money and things
Especially when you're standing there 
Wearing diamond and rings 
You think I'm soft in the head
Well try someone softer instead anything 
It's not so funny 
When you know what money can bring
You better leave me alone
I don't need a thing from you 
You better take yourself home 
Go and count a ring or two 
If you've got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me
You're quite contend to be bad 
With all the vantage you had over me
Just cause your trouble 
And don't bring your troubles to me
Ah, rock on, anybody 
You better leave me alone
I don't need a thing from you 
You better take yourself home 
Go and count a ring or two 
If you've got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me
You're quite content to be bad 
With all the vantage you had over me 
Just cause your trouble 
And don't bring your troubles to me
Just cause your trouble 
And don't bring your troubles to me 



Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky

Imagine all the people
Living for today (ah ah ah)

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion, too

Imagine all the people
Living life in peace 

You may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man

Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world

You may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one


There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more
In my life-- I love you more


In spite of all the danger
In spite of all that may be 
I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me to
If you'll be true to me

In spite of all the heartache
That you may cause me
I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me to
If you'll be true to me

I'll look after you 
Like I've never done before
I'll keep all the others 
From knocking at your door

In spite of all the danger
In spite of all that may be
I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me to
If you'll be true to me

In spite of all the heartache 
That you may cause me
I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me to
If you'll be true to me
I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me to
If you'll be true to me

[Instrumental]


It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you

Every night when everybody has fun
Here am I sitting all on my own

It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you

Since you left me, I'm so alone
Now you're coming, you're coming on home
I'll be good like I know I should
You're coming home, you're coming home

Every night the tears come down from my eyes
Every day I've done nothing but cry

It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you

Since you left me, I'm so alone
Now you're coming, you're coming on home
I'll be good like I know I should
You're coming home, you're coming home

So every day we'll be happy I know
Now I know that you won't leave me no more

It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you, woo


It's all too much, it's all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world's a birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea

It's all to much for me to see
A love that's shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

It's too much, it's too much

Too much, too much, too much


I'd say some day
I'm bound to give my heart away
When I do
It's for you love, true love
Seems to be all I'm thinking of
But it's true
It's for you
They said that love was a lie
Told me that I 
Never should try to find
Somebody who'd be kind
Kind to only me
So I just tell them they're right
Who wants a fight
Tell them I quite agree
Nobody'd love me
Then I look at you
And love comes love shows
I give my heart and no one knows
That I do
It's for you
It's for you
It's for you


I get high when I see you go by, (my oh my)
When you sigh my inside just flies, (butterflies)
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you

It's only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do
It's only love and that is all,
But it's so hard loving you

Is it right that you and I should fight, (every night)
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright, (very bright)
Haven't I the right to make it up girl

It's only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do
It's only love and that is all,
But it's so hard loving you
Yes it's so hard loving you
Loving you


Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh 
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright 
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight 

[Chorus:]
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh 
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride 
And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side 
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot 
He got into a drifted bank and we got upsot 

[Chorus:]

A day or two ago, the story I must tell 
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh 
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away 

[Chorus:]

Now the ground is white, go it while you're young 
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed 
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead 

[Chorus:]


Deep down in Louisiana 
Close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods 
Among the evergreens
There stands a country cabin
Made of clay and wood
Where lives a young country boy
Named Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned 
To read or write a book so well
But he could play his guitar 
Just like a-ringing a bell 

Go, go, go Johnny go, go, go! 
Go Johnny go, go, go! 
Go Johnny go, go, go! 
Go Johnny go, go, go! 
Ah, Johnny B. Goode!

He used to carry his guitar
In a gunny sack
Sit beneath the trees
By the railroad track
Oh, sitting and a-playing 
In the shade
Drumming to the rhythm
That the drivers made
People passing by 
Used to stop and say 
My oh my 
That country boy can play

Go, go, go Johnny go, go, go! 
Go Johnny go, go, go! 
Go Johnny go, go, go! 
Go Johnny go, go, go! 
Ah, Johnny B. Goode!

Well, his mama told him 
"Some day you will be a man
And you will be the leader 
Of a big old band
Many people coming 
From miles around
To hear you play your music 
Until the sun goes down
Maybe some day 
Your name will be in light
Saying: Johnny B. Goode Tonight!" 

Go, go, go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go! 
Go Johnny go, go, go! 
Go Johnny go, go, go! 
Ah, Johnny B. Goode!



Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia, ocean child, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Hum, hum, hum, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia, Julia, Julia

Keep your hands (keep your hands) off my bay-ee-a-by

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

See how they run

Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet


You better leave my kitten all alone, 
You better leave my kitten all alone. 
But I told you big fat bulldog, 
You better leave her alone. 

You better leave my kitten all alone, 
You better leave my kitten all alone. 
This dog is gonna get you 
If you don't leave her alone. 

Well Mr.Dog I'm gonna hit you 
On the top of your head. 
That child is gonna miss you, 
You gonna wish that you were dead. 
If you don't leave my kitten all alone. 
Well I told you big fat bulldog, 
You better leave her alone. 

Well Mr.Dog I'm gonna hit you

You better leave her alone. 

Hey hey you better leave, you better leave, 
You better leave, yeah you better leave, 
You better leave, oh you got to leave...


Lend me your comb
It's time to go home 
I got to go past
My hair is a mess 

Your mammie will scold
Your pappie will shout
Unless we come in 
The way we went out

Kissing you was fun honey 
But thanks for the date
But I must come to run honey 
But you know baby it's getting late

Just wait till I say
My darling
Lend me your comb
We got to go home
Kissing you was fun honey

But thanks for the date 
But I must come to run, honey
But sugar, it's getting late

Just wait till I 
Say, my darling
Lend me your comb
We got to go home


When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be


I, I saw a girl in my dreams
And so it seems
That I will love her
Oh you, you are that girl
In my dreams
And so it seems
That I will love you

And I waited for your kiss
Waited for the bliss
Like dreamers do

And I, I, I, I
Oh I'll be there, yeah
Waiting for you, you, you, you, you
You, you came just one dream ago
And now I know that I will love you
I knew when you first said hello
That's how I know
That I will love you

And I, I, I waited for your kiss
Waited for the bliss
Like dreamers do

And I, I, I, I
Oh I'll be there, yeah
Waiting for you, you, you, you, you
You, you came just one dream ago
And now I know that I will love you
Oh I knew when you first said hello
That's how I know
That I will love you

And I waited for your kiss
Waited for the bliss
Like dreamers do
Oh, like dreamers do
Like dreamers do


Little child, little child,
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely,
Baby take a chance with me.

Little child, little child,
Little child, won't you dance with me?

To make you feel so fine,

So come, come on, come on.

Just come on, come on,
So come on, come on, come on.

Little child, little child,
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely,
Baby take a chance with me.
Baby take a chance with me.
Baby take a chance with me.

Each time I look into your eyes 
I see that there a heaven lies 
And as I look 
I see the love of the loved. 

Someday they'll see that from the start 
My place has been deep in your heart. 
And in your heart 
I see the love of the loved. 

Though I said it all before 
I will say it more and more, 
Now that I'm really sure 
You love me. 

And I know that from today 
I'll see it in the way 
That you look at me 
And say ah you love me. 

So let it rain, I'll never care? 
Deep in your heart, I'd still be there. 
And when I'm there 
I see the love of the loved. 

Though I said it all before 
I will say it more and more, 
Now that I'm really sure 
You love me. 

And I know that from today 
I'll see it in the way 
That you look at me 
And say ah you love me. 

So let it rain, I'll never I care? 
Deep in your heart, I'd still be there. 
And when I'm there 

I see the love of the loved. 
I see the love of the loved. 
I see the love of the loved.


Each day just goes so fast
I turn around, it's past
You don't get time to hang a sign on me

Love me while you can
Or I'll get a plan

A lifetime is so short
A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

There's people standing round
Who screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with all the things you see

I'll make love to you
If you want me to


Lovely Rita meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away

Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

Lovely Rita meter maid
May I inquire discreetly
When are you free to take some tea with me
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again

Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two

Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you
Give us a wink and make me think of you


Ah Lucille
Baby do your sister's will
Ah Lucille
Baby do your sister's will
Well you went up and married
But I love you still

Ah Lucille
Baby satisfy my soul
Ah Lucille
Baby satisfy my soul
Well you know I love baby
I'll never let you go

Babe I woke up this morning
Lucille was not inside
I asked her friends about her
But all their lips were tight

Lucille
Please come back where you belong
Well I'm talking to you baby
I'll never put you on
Ah! Wha'!

Well Lucille
Baby do your sister's will
Oh Lucille
Yeah baby do your sister's will
Well you went up and married
But I love you still


Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds


Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbin' Maggie Mae
To the port of Liverpool
They returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

She wrote me only one sad night, 
Told me she's no longer mine. 
Sue sue mailman, that will do for sometime. 

Mailman, bring me no more blues. 
Mailman, bring me no more blues. 
One more heartache is all I can use. 

Mailman, bring me no more blues. 
Mailman, bring me no more blues

Martha, my dear
Though I spend my days in conversation, please
Remember me
Martha, my love
Don't forget me
Martha, my dear

Hold your head up, you silly girl
Look what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl

Take a good look around you
Take a good look you're bound to see
That you and me were meant to be
With each other
Silly girl

Hold you're hand out, you silly girl
See what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl

Martha, my dear
You have always been my inspiration
Please, be good to me
Martha, my love
Don't forget me
Martha, my dear.


I said I'm sitting here watching 
matchbox hole in my clothes 
I said I'm sitting here wondering 
matchbox hole in my clothes 
I ain't got no matches 
but I sure got a long way to go
I'm an old poor boy 
I'm a long way from home
I'm an old poor boy 
and I'm a long way from home
I've never been happy 
cause everything I ever did was wrong 
Well, if you don't want my peaches 
honey please don't shake my tree 
If you don't want any of those peaches
honey, please don't mess around my tree 
I've got news for you baby 
Leave me here in misery, all right! 
Well let me be your little dog 
till your big dog comes 
Let me be your little dog 
till your big dog comes 
And when your big dog gets here
watch how your puppy dog runs 
Well I said I'm sitting here watching 
matchbox hole in my clothes 
I said I'm sitting here wondering 
matchbox hole in my clothes 
I ain't got no matches 
but I sure got a long way to go



Joan was quizzical; studied pataphysical
Science in the home.
Late nights all alone with a test tube.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine,
Calls her on the phone.
"Can I take you out to the pictures,
Joa, oa, oa, oan?"

But as she's getting ready to go,
A knock comes on the door.

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead.

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again.
Teacher gets annoyed.
Wishing to avoid and unpleasant
Sce, e, e, ene,

She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away,
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times "I must not be
So, o, o, o"

But when she turns her back on the boy,
He creeps up from behind.

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead.

P. C. Thirty-one said, "We caught a dirty one."
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them
So, o, o, o.

But as the words are leaving his lips,
A noise comes from behind.

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead.

Whoa, oh, oh, oh.
Silver hammer man


Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man


[Instrumental]


Long distance information 
Give me Memphis Tennessee. 
Try to find the party 
Trying to get in touch with me. 
She would not leave her number 
But I know who placed the call. 
'Cause my uncle took the message 
And he wrote it on the wall. 

Help me, information, 
Get in touch with my Marie. 
She's the only one who'd phone me here 
From Memphis Tennessee. 
Her home is on the south side 
Just beyond the ridge, 
Just a half a mile 
From the Mississippi Bridge. 

Help me, information, 
More than that I cannot add. 
Only that I miss her 
And all the fun we had. 
We were pulled apart 
Because her mom would not agree. 
Help me get in touch with her 
In Memphis Tennessee. 

The last time I saw Marie 
She was waving me goodbye, 
With hurry homedrops on her cheek 
That trickled from her eyes. 
Marie is only six years old, 
Information please. 
Help me get in touch with her 
In Memphis Tennessee.

We were strolling along (twist and shout!) 
On Moonlight Bay (woo hoo!) 
We could hear the voices singing (I like it!) 
You said you'd stay 
You have broken my heart (oh, twist and shout!) 
So don't go away 
With your short and hairy legs 
On Moonlight Bay 
On Moonlight Bay


Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grass
Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

Mother Nature's son.


Mister Moonlight
You came to me one summer night
And from your beam you made my dream
And from the world you sent my girl
And from above you sent us love
And now she is mine, I think you're fine
'Cause we love you Mister Moonlight

Mister Moonlight come again please
Here I am on my knees begging if you please
And the night you don't come my way
I pray and pray more each day
'Cause we love you Mister Moonlight

And the night you don't come my way
I pray and pray more each day
'Cause we love you Mister Moonlight

Mister Moonlight come again please
Here I am on my knees begging if you please
And the night you don't come my way
I pray and pray more each day
'Cause we love you Mister Moonlight

This happened once before
When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through
Your window
I saw the light
I saw the light
I know that you saw me
'Cause I looked up to see
Your face

I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
And I saw you walk in
Your door
I nearly died
I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man
In my place

If I were you, I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before, when you gave me no reply

I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
And I saw you walk in
Your door
I nearly died
I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man
In my place
No reply
No reply


Nobody I know could love me more than you,
You can give me so much love it seems untrue,
Listen to the bird who sings it to th tree,
And then when you've heard him see if you agree,

Nobody I know could love you more than me.
Everywhere I go the sun comes shining through,
Everyone I know is sure it shines for you,
Even in my dreams

I look into your eyes,
Suddenly it seems
I've found a paradise,
Everywhere I go the sun comes shining through,

It means so much to be a part of a heart of a wonderful one,
When other lovers are gone we'll live on,
We'll live on.
Even in my dreams

I look into your eyes,
Suddenly it seems
I've found a paradise,
Everywhere I go the sun comes shining through,

Nobody I know could love me more than you,
You can give me so much love it seems untrue,
Listen to the bird who sings it to the tree,
And then when you've heard him see if you agree,

Nobody I know could love you more than me.
Nobody I know could love you more than me.


As I was slowly passing 
An orphan's home one day, 
I stopped for just a little while 
To watch the children play. 
Alone a boy was standing 
And when I asked him why, 
He turned with eyes that could not see 
And he began to cry. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child. 

No mummy's arms to hold me 
Or sue me when I cry, 
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome 
I wish that I could die. 
I'll walk the streets of heaven 
Where all blinds can see. 

And just like for the other kids 
It will be a home for me. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child.


I once had a girl
Or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
"It's time for bed"

She told me she worked
In the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?


You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you

And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry it's through, oh

You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no, not a second time

You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you, yea

And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry it's through, oh

You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no, not a second time
Not a second time
Not the second time
No, no, no, no, no
No, no no


Not guilty 
For getting in your way 
While you're trying to steal the day. 
Not guilty 
And I'm not here for the rest, 
I'm not trying to steal your vest. 

I am not trying to be smart, 
I only want what I can get. 
I'm really sorry for your ageing head. 
But like you heard me said: 
Not guilty. 

No use handing me a writ 
While I'm trying to do my bit. 

I don't expect to take your heart. 
I only want what I can get. 
I'm really sorry that you're underfed. 
But like you heard me said: 
Not guilty. 

Not guilty 
For looking like a freak, 
Making friends with every Sikh. 
Not guilty 
For leading you astray 
On the road to Mandalay. 

I won't upset the apple cart. 
I only want what I can get. 
I'm really sorry that you've been misled. 
But like you heard me said: 
Not guilty.


I tried to find out 
What love is all about, 
And every day 
It sure lets out. 
I see my baby 
I get week in my knees. 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees. 
My pappie told me 
There'd be times like these. 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees. 

We meet the gang 
And go to rocking Joes. 
The cats are something 
On the heels and toes. 
I grab my baby, 
Tried to give her a squeeze. 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees. 
Why must she be 
Such a doggone tease? 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees. 

She's got a way 
That makes me act like a fool. 
Spent my money, 
Then she plays me cool. 
I beg her for kisses 
On my bended knees. 
Oh won't you give me 
Some loving, baby, 
Please please please. 

Though I keep trying hard 
To make her mine, 
One day the wind will blow 
And the sun will shine. 
Till that time 
She puts my heart at ease. 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees 
She locked my heart 
And threw away the keys. 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees, yeah. 

She's got a way 
That makes me act like a fool. 
Spent my money, 
Then she plays me cool. 
I'm begging her for kisses 
On my bended knees. 
Oh won't you give me 
Some of your loving, baby, 
Please please please. 

Though I keep trying hard 
To make her mine, 
One day the wind will blow 
And the sun will shine. 
Till that time 
She puts my heart at ease. 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees 
She locked my heart 
And threw away the keys. 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees


He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere man please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man, The world is at your command

He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere man, can you see me at all
Nowhere man don't worry
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else
Lends you a hand
Ah, la, la, la, la

Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere man please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man, The world is at your command
Ah, la, la, la, la

He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody


Desmond has a barrow in the marketplace
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, girl, I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

Ob la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Ob-la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on

Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweller's store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing

Ob la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Ob-la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones

Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band

Ob la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Ob-la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones

Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening she's a singer with the band

Ob la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Ob-la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on

And if you want some fun, sing ob-la-di, bla-da


I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus' garden in the shade

I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus' garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus' garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden with you.


Oh my love for the first time in my life
My eyes are wide open
Oh my love for the first time in my life
My eyes can see

I see the wind
Oh, I see the trees
Everything is clear in my heart
I see the clouds
Oh, I see the sky
Everything is clear in our world

Oh my love for the first time in my life
My mind is wide open
Oh my lover for the first time in my life
My mind can feel

I feel the sorrow
Oh, I feel dreams
Everything is clear in my heart
I feel life
Oh, I feel love
Everything is clear in our world


Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Don't ever leave me alone

When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
I'll never do you no harm, no harm

When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried

Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm


I want a love that's right 
But right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl 
Who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now
I'm telling you

You know you pick me up 
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile 
Replace every thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now 
When I'm with you

If I grow up I'll be a singer 
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say 
I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather 
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late

For you sweet top lip I'm in the queue
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now 
When I'm with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now 
When I'm with you


My baby said she's trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.
Said she's trav'ling on the one after 909.

I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
You're only fooling around, you're fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.
Said she's trav'ling on the one after 909.

I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well she said she's trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.
Said she's trav'ling on the one after 909.

I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well she said she's trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.
Said she's trav'ling on the one after 9-0,
Said she's trav'ling on the one after 9-0,
Said she's trav'ling on the one after 909.


One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?

[Chorus]
I'm hoping everyday
I'm gonna hear you say
"You really make my wish come true"

Can you feel when I'm holding you near
All the things that I do?
So, my love, am I making it clear?
One and one is two

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?

[Chorus]

Can't you see I've loved you from the start?
Don't you love me too?
I love you, but you're breaking my heart
From wanting you.

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?

[Chorus]

If you say that you're gonna be mine
Everything is alright
All the world would look so fine
If you'll be mine tonight

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?

[Chorus]


Baby's good to me, you know
She's happy as can be, you know
She said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine

Baby says she's mine, you know
She tells me all the time, you know
She said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine

I'm so glad that she's my little girl
She's so glad, she's telling all the world
That here baby buys her things, you know
He buys her diamond rings, you know
She said so
She's in love with me and I feel fine

Baby says she's mine, you know
She tells me all the time, you know
She said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine

I'm so glad that she's my little girl
She's so glad, she's telling all the world
That her baby buys her things, you know
He buys her diamond rings, you know
She said so
She's in love with me and I feel fine
She's in love with me and I feel fine


If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
We just wrote them like that

If you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
The just play it like that

And it doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say
Or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song

It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
What words I pair
Or if my hair is brown
'Cause it's only a Northern song

If you think the harmony
Is a little dull and out of key
You're correct
'Cause there's nobody there

And it's only there's no one there


(Penniman)

Paperback writer, paperback writer.
Dear Sir or Madam, will you read my book?
It took me years to write, will you take a look?
It's based on a novel by a man named Lear,
And I need a job,
So I want to be a paperback writer,
Paperback writer.

It's a dirty story of a dirty man,
And his clinging wife doesn't understand.
His son is working for the Daily Mail
It's a steady job,
But he wants to be a paperback writer,
Paperback writer.
Paperback writer, paperback writer.

It's a thousand pages, give or take a few.
I'll be writing more in a week or two.
I could make it longer if you like the style.
I can change it 'round,
And I want to be a paperback writer,
Paperback writer.

If you really like it you can have the rights.
It could make a million for you overnight.
If you must return it you can send it here,
But I need a break,
And I want to be a paperback writer,
Paperback writer.

Paperback writer, paperback writer.
Paperback writer, paperback writer.
Paperback writer, paperback writer.
Paperback writer, paperback writer.
Paperback writer...


I'm looking at the candle, burns a flame to meet the sky.
I leave the candle laughing, I turn my face to cry.
A safety pin returns my smile, I nod a brief hello,
while you are building molecules with your garden hoe.

Why can't this last forever'these things repressed inside?
One feels it almost instantly, unless one of us died.
It's over, it's done, babe I need it again.
Just please, please, please, oh, don't keep me from begin.

I need to hear the colors red and blue and whispered word.
To fly all day and sing in tune and not hear what I'd heard.
To see you all around me and to take you by the hand,
and lead you to a brand new world that lately has been banned.

We'll build things never built before, we'll do things never done.
And just before it's over, it's really just begun.


I'm pedro the fisherman
i fish by night and day
unfortunately i live in bristol
far far away
and there aint no fish to be caught
no fish to be caught

There aint no sea
the counseller came
away from me

i'm pedro the fisherman
with not a fish to fash
ive got a hook on the line,
big mac
a top 
some red socks 
a pair of wellies 
and a bit of wine

So im goin to go


Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say "Hello".

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
And little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass,
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
It's a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer. Meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray.
And though she feels as if she's in a play,
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim,
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain - very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane!

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse,
Always having dirt to play around in

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt,
Always have clean shirts to play around in

In their styes with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking

Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat the bacon


Wait, oh yes, wait a minute, Mister Postman
Wait, wait, hey, hey, hey, Mister Postman

From my girlfriend so far away
Please, Mister Postman, look and see

Saying she's returning home to me

(Please, Mister Postman) Mister Postman look and see
(Oh, yeah) Is there a letter in your bag for me?
(Please, please, Mister Postman) I been waiting a long, long time

So many days you passed me by
See the tear standing in my eye
You didn't stop to make me feel better
By leaving me a card or a letter

Mister Postman, look and see
Is there a letter in your bag for me?
I been waiting a long, long time
Since I heard from that girlfriend of mine

You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah

You gotta check it and see, one more time for me
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah

You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah

Last night I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl
Come on, (come on) come on, (come on) come on, (come on) come on, (come on) 
Please, please me, woah yeah, like I please you

You don't need me to show the way, love
Why do I always have to say, love
Come on, (come on) come on, (come on) come on, (come on) come on, (come on) 
Please, please me, woah yeah, like I please you

I don't want to sound complaining
But you know there's always rain in my heart (in my heart)

It's so hard to reason with you
Woah yeah, why do you make me blue?

Last night I said these words to my girl

Well, you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes the "News of the World"
Yes, you could say she was attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah


If the rain comes
They run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead
If the rain comes
If the rain comes

When the sun shines
They slip into the shade
And sip their lemonade
When the sun shines
When the sun shines

Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine

I can show you
That when it starts to rain
Everything's the same
I can show you
I can show you

Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine

Can you hear me
That when it rains and shines
It's just a state of mind
Can you hear me
Can you hear me


Ready - set - go man go
I got a gal that I love so

I'm ready - ready ready Teddy
I'm ready - ready ready Teddy
I'm ready - ready ready Teddy
I'm ready ready ready to rock 'n' roll

Goin' down to the corner, pick up my sweetie pie
She's my rock 'n' roll baby, she's the apple of my eye (chorus)

Well, the flat top cats and the dungaree dolls
Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball
The joint is really jumpin', the cats are goin' wild
The music really sends me, I dig that crazy style (chorus)

Gonna kick off my shoes, roll up my faded jeans
Grab my rock 'n' roll baby, pour on the steam
I shuffle to the left, I shuffle to the right
Gonna rock 'n' roll 'til the early early night


All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for love

Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
It's real love, it's real
Yes, it's real love, it's real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid
It's real love, it's real
Yes, it's real love, it's real

Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart, I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Don't need to be alone
Don't need to be alone
It's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes, it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes, it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes, it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real


You say you want a revolution, well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution, well you know
We all want to change the world

But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know you can count me out, in

Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright

You say you got a real solution, well you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution, well you know
We're doing what we can

But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you'll have to wait

Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright

You say you'll change the constitution, well you know
We'd all love to change your head
You tell me it's the institution, well you know
You better free your mind instead

But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow

Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Alright, alright

I don't care if I spent my dough 
night gonna be
Gonna rock it up, 
gonna shake it up, 
gonna roll it up, 
have 'em ball tonight.
Rattle and roll, 
I said shake rattle and roll, 
Well you never done nothing 
to save your doggone soul. 
Well get out of that kitchen 
and shake those pots and pans. 
I said get out of that kitchen 
and shake those pots and pans. 
I said to my soul: 
you're the devil in a frying pan.
Well I said shake rattle and roll, 
I said shake rattle and roll, 
I said shake rattle and roll, 
I said shake rattle and roll. 
Well you never done nothing 
to save your doggone soul. 
You can knock me down, 
slap my face, 
slander my name 
all over the place. 
Do anything that you want to do,
but oh oh honey, 
lay off of them shoes.
Now don't you step 
on my blue suede shoes.
Well you can do anything 
but lay off of them blue suede shoes.
Ah go! 
You can burn my house,
steal my car, 
drink my liquor 
from an old fruit jar.
Do anything 
that you want to do,
but ah ah honey, 
lay off of them shoes.
And don't you step 
on my blue suede shoes, please.
Well you can do anything 
but lay off of them blue suede shoes.
Ah go, hit it, Carl [Perkins]! 
Well blue blue, 
blue suede shoes. 
Yeah blue blue, 
blue suede shoes. 
Babe blue blue, 
blue suede shoes. 
Yeah brown brown 
brown suede boots. 
Well do anything 
but lay off of them blue suede shoes.



Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man, they were blowin' like a hurrican'
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Way down South they had a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin' there are all shook up
And started playin' that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
And In The Mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin' that piano
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me


Now somewhere in the Black Mountain Hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come, equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

Now the doctor came in, stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"

Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it, no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival


Well gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local D.J.
It's a rockin' little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
I gotta hear it again today
You know my temperature's risin'
And the jukebox's blowin' a fuse
My hearts beatin' rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
I got a rockin' pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I got it off the writer
Sittin' down by the rhythm review
Roll over Beethoven
We're rockin' in two by two
Well if you fell you like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just jump around and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
A rockin' in two by two, oh
Well early in the mornin'
I'm a givin' you the warnin'
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey little little
Gonna play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lost
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
You know she winks like a glow worm
Dance like a spinnin' top
She got a crazy partner
Oughta see 'em reel an rock
Long as she's got a dime
The music will never stop
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
And dig these rhythm and blues

Well, I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or you won't know where I am

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end'a little girl

Well, you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life
Trying just to make you toe the line

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end'a little girl

Let this be a sermon
I mean everything I've said
Baby, I'm determined
And I'd rather see you dead

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end'a little girl

I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or you won't know where I am

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end'a little girl
Na, na, na
Na, na, na

Creme tangerine and montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
A coffee dessert, yes you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

Cool cherry cream, a nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge, really blows down those blues
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
You're going to know, and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You shout aloud

You'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

You know that what you eat you are,
But what is sweet now, turns so sour
We all know Obla-Di-Bla-Da
But can you show me, where you are?

Creme tangerine and montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
A coffee dessert, yes you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out

Yes you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

1 2 2 toobidoo. 
The leaves of brown 
Came tumbling down, 
Remember in September in the rain. 
The sun went out 
Just like a light, 
Remember in September in the rain. 

To every word 
Of love I heard you whisper 
The raindrops seems 
To play a sweet refrain. 
Thought it's spring, 
To me it's still September, 
Oh that September in the rain. 

To every word

Ah September in the rain.


Sexy Sadie, what have you done
You made a fool of everyone
You made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie, ooh, what have you done

Sexy Sadie, you broke the rules
You laid it down for all to see
You laid it down for all to see
Sexy Sadie, ooh, you broke the rules

One sunny day the world was waiting for a lover
She came along and turned on everyone
Sexy Sadie, the greatest of them all

Sexy Sadie, how did you know
The world was waiting just for you
The world was waiting just for you
Sexy Sadie, ooh, how did you know

Sexy Sadie, you'll get yours yet
However big you think you are
However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie, ooh, you'll get yours yet

We gave her everything we owned just to sit at her table
Just a smile would lighten everything
Sexy Sadie, she's the latest and the greatest of them all

She made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie

However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie


It was twenty years ago today,
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play,
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile.

The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

I don't care if I spent my dough 
night gonna be
Gonna rock it up, 
gonna shake it up, 
gonna roll it up, 
have 'em ball tonight.
Rattle and roll, 
I said shake rattle and roll, 
Well you never done nothing 
to save your doggone soul. 
Well get out of that kitchen 
and shake those pots and pans. 
I said get out of that kitchen 
and shake those pots and pans. 
I said to my soul: 
you're the devil in a frying pan.
Well I said shake rattle and roll, 
I said shake rattle and roll,

I said shake rattle and roll. 
Well you never done nothing 
to save your doggone soul. 
You can knock me down, 
slap my face, 
slander my name 
all over the place. 
Do anything that you want to do,
but oh oh honey, 
lay off of them shoes.
Now don't you step 
on my blue suede shoes.
Well you can do anything 
but lay off of them blue suede shoes.
Ah go! 
You can burn my house,
steal my car, 
drink my liquor 
from an old fruit jar.
Do anything 
that you want to do,
but ah ah honey, 
lay off of them shoes.
And don't you step 
on my blue suede shoes, please.
Well you can do anything 
but lay off of them blue suede shoes.
Ah go, hit it, Carl [Perkins]! 
Well blue blue,

Babe blue blue,

Yeah brown brown

Well do anything 
but lay off of them blue suede shoes.


She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday,
Tuesday's on the phone to me
Oh yeah


She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah

You think you've lost your love
Well, I saw her yesterday-yi-yay
It's you she's thinking of
And she told me what to say-yi-yay

She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad

She said you hurt her so
She almost lost her mind
And now she says she knows
You're not the hurting kind

She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad

Oo, she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
With a love like that
You know you should be glad

You know it's up to you
I think it's only fair
Pride can hurt you too
Apologize to her

Because she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad

Oo, she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
With a love like that
You know you should be glad
With a love like that
You know you should be glad
With a love like that
You know you should be glad
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


She said
I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And she's making me feel like I've never been born

I said
Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel like I'm sad
And you're making me feel like I've never been born


She said you don't understand what I said
I said no no no you're wrong
When I was a boy, everything was right
Everything was right

I said
Even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born

She said you don't understand what I said
I said no no no you're wrong
When I was a boy, everything was right
Everything was right

I said
Even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born

She said
I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
I know what it is to be sad


My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents

Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only fooling
I know she isn't

She don't give boys the eye
She hates to see me cry
She is happy just to hear me
Say that I will never leave her
She don't give boys the eye

She will never make me jealous
Gives me all her time as well as loving
Don't ask me why

She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man

My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents

Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only fooling
I know she isn't, woo ooh

She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man

Her love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents

Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only fooling
I know she isn't

She's a woman, she's a woman
She's a woman, she's a woman, she's a woman


Wednesday morning at five o'clock
As the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more

She goes downstairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free

She(we gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (we gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home, after living alone, for so many years (bye bye)

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
"Daddy, our baby's gone.
"Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?"

She (we never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (never a thought for ourselves)
Home (we struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home, after living alone, for so many years

Friday morning, at nine o'clock
She is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the Motortrade

She (what did we do that was wrong)
Is Having (we didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (fun is the one thing that money can't buy)

Something inside, that was always denied, for so many years
She's leaving home, bye, bye


(Instrumental)

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how


If your life's not right, doesn't satisfy you
Don't get the breaks like some of us do
Better work it out, find where you've gone wrong
Better do it soon as you don't have long. 

Get out of Sour Milk Sea 
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there. 

If you want the most from everything you do
In the shortest time your dreams come true
In no time at all it makes you more aware
Very simple process takes you there. 

Get out of Sour Milk Sea 
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there. 

Looking for release from limitation
There's nothing much without illumination
Can fool around with every different cult
There's only one way brings results.

Get out of Sour Milk Sea 
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there.


When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see

No I won't be afraid
No I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

So darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand by, oh stand, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea

I won't cry, I won't cry
No I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand by, oh stand, stand by me

So darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand by, oh stand, stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble would you stand by me?
Oh, stand by
Oh, stand by, oh stand, stand by me

So darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand by, oh stand, stand by me

You're a stranger in my arms
when i saw you standing there
without a wooly ho i hair
you're a stranger in my arms

you're a stranger in my arms
i want it so much
and me on a road somewhere

You're a stranger in my arms
when the lights are very low
and the sky is on the celing
and there's no one there to know

Oh its gone off


Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you know you can't tune it
But it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

Always know sometimes it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know I mean a "Yes"
But it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever


Here comes the sun king

I'm sure to fall
Fall in love
I'm sure to fall in love with you

You are so sweet
And so near
I'm sure to fall in love with you

So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling, don't ever let me go

Loving you
Is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life

So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling, don't ever let me go

Loving you
Is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life



Way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away
That's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay

Way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away-hey
Whoa, that's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay

All up and down the whole creation,
Sadly I roam
I'm a still a-longin' for the old plantation,
Oh, for the old folks at home

Ah-oh-oh!

Oh, my my!

Well, way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away-hey.
Whoa, that's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay.

All up and down the whole creation,
Sadly I roam.
I'm still a-longin' for the old plantation,
And for the old folks at home.

All the world is sad and dreary,
Ev'rywhere I roam
Oh, darkies, how my heart grows weary,
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home


Well let me tell you well no chick made 
Could be the same 
As Sweet Georgia Brown. 
Crazy feet that dance so neat 
Has sweet Georgia Brown. 
Fella's sigh, and even cry 
For sweet Georgia Brown. 
I tell you just why 
You know I don't lie. 

It's been said 
She knocks them dead 
In any old town. 
Since she came right 
It's a shame 
How she brings them down. 
In Liverpool she even dare 
To critize the Beatles' hair. 
With their whole fanclub 
Standing there 
I mean sweet Georgia Brown. 

I say this group is absolutely marvellous with the piano, don't you 
Think so. Not too commercial, boys, not too commercial! 

When it comes to music 
Sweet Georgia is known to mind, 
Don't buy clothes at fashion shows 
But she still looks fine 
Snap chicks cry, 
They want to die 
When Georgie does the twist 
I never would try 
To tell you just why. 
Use your imagination 
There's a DJ crazy for her 
Living in out home town 
Since she came it's a shame 
She turns him down 
Records that she can get 
Are records, they ain't sent him yet 
Carolina may have Dina, 
But that don't have Georgia Brown. 

Oh that sweet Georgia, 
Yeah yeah yeah I mean Brown, oh oh oh. 
Sweet Georgia Brown.


They're really rocking in Boston, 
In Philadelphia PA, 
Deep in the heart of Texas, 
On down the Frisco Bay. 
All over Saint Louis 
And down in New Orleans. 
All the cats want to dance with 
Sweet little sixteen. 

Sweet little sixteen, 
She's just got to have 
About half a million 
Framed autopraphs. 
Her wall is filled with pictures, 
She gets them one by one. 
Becomes so excited, 
Oh watch her at the run boy. 

Oh mommy mommy, 
Please may I go. 
You know it's such a sight to see 
Somebody steal the show. 
Oh daddy daddy, 
I beg of you. 
Please say it to mommy 
It's alright with you. 

Sweet little sixteen 
She's got the grown up blues. 
Tight dresses and lipstick, 
She's sporting in high heeled boots. 
Oh but tomorrow morning 
She'll have to change her trend 
Become sweet sixteen 
And back in class again. 

They're really rocking in Boston, 
In Philadelphia PA, 
Deep in the heart of Texas 
And down the Frisco Bay. 
All over Saint Louis, 
On down in New Orleans. 
All the cats want to dance with 
Sweet little sixteen


My tears are fallin' cause you've taken her away
And through it really hurts me so
There's something that I gotta say 
Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinking of her
In everything you say and do
Take good care of my baby
Now don't you ever make her cry
Just let your love surround her
Don't let her see a cloudy sky
Once upon a time that little girl was mine
If I'd been true I know she'd never be with you, so
Take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me
Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinking of her
In everything you say and do
Take good care of my baby
Now don't you ever make her cry
Just let your love surround her
Don't let her see a cloudy sky
Once upon a time that little girl was mine
If I'd been true I know she'd never be with you, so
Take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me
Oh take good care of my baby, take good care of my baby
Just take good care of my baby



As I was slowly passing 
An orphan's home one day, 
I stopped for just a little while 
To watch the children play. 
Alone a boy was standing 
And when I asked him why, 
He turned with eyes that could not see 
And he began to cry. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child. 

No mummy's arms to hold me 
Or sue me when I cry, 
'cause sometimes I feel so lonesome 
I wish that I could die. 
I'll walk the streets of heaven 
Where all blinds can see. 

And just like for the other kids 
It will be a home for me. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child.


Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah I'm the taxman

If you drive a car, I'll tax the street,
If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat.
If you get too cold I'll tax the heat,
If you take a walk, I'll tax your feet.

Don't ask me what I want it for
If you don't want to pay some more
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman
And you're working for no one but me.


This is the story 
about a boy named Ted.
If his mother said: 
Ted, be good, he would. 
Be good, Ted. Alright. 
She told him tales 
about a soldier dad, 
but it made her sad. 
Then she cried, oh my. 
Ted used to tell her 
he'd be twice as good 
and he knew he could, 
'cos in his head he said: 
Mummy don't worry, 
your Teddy boy's here 
taking good care of you. 
Mama don't worry, 
your Teddy boy's here.
Teddy's gonna see you through.
And she said: 
Teddy don't worry 
your mummy's here, 
taking good care of you.
She said: Teddy don't worry,
your mummy's here, 
Teddy's gonna see you through.
He said: ta da da... 
Then came the day 
she found herself a man. 
Teddy turned and ran 
oh far away, oh yeah. 
He couldn't stand 
just to be around, 
so he left the town 
far away, yeah yeah. 
Ted used to tell her 
he'd be twice as good 
and he know he could, 
'cos in his head he said: 
Mummy don't worry, 
now Teddy boy's here, 
taking good care of you. 
Mummy don't worry, 
your Teddy boy's here. 
Teddy's gonna see you through.
And she said: 
Teddy don't worry,
now mummy's here, 
taking good care of you.
Teddy don't worry, 
your mummy's here, 
mummy's gonna see you through. 
And he said: 
Mummy mummy don't worry,
your Teddy boy's here 
taking good care of you. 
Mummy don't worry, 
now Teddy boy's here. 
Teddy's gonna see you through.
Take your partner 
and don't, 
hold them tight
and don't let go. 
Got it. Jump up. 
Take your partners 
and don't see 
when you got it, 
then let it go 
Hold them tight then. 
Now Ted used to tell her 
he'd be twice as good, 
and he knew he could 
'cos in his head, he said:


If you let me take your heart, I will prove to you
We will never be apart, if I'm part of you
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me

Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away
If you put your trust in me, I'll make bright your day
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see
Don't you realize now, what you see is me
Tell me what you see

Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm, trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me
Tell me what you see

Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm, trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me

Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm


Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

Well, I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh, so bad
All I do is hang my head and moan

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

If there's something I have said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologize
If you don't really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

Well, I beg you on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my pleas
Is there anything I can do
'Cause I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me


Ah, ah, you've been good to me
You made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be in love with you
And all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love
I know little girl only a fool would doubt our love
And all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl

Thank you girl for loving me 
The way that you do (way that you do)
That's the kind of love that is too good to be true
And all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl

You made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be in love with you
And all I gotta do is thank you girl

A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
And you know that your love is all you've got
At times things are so fine and at times they're not
But when she says she loves you, that means a lot

A friend says that a love is never true
But you know that this don't apply to you
A touch can mean so much when it's all you've got
And when she says she loves you that means a lot

Love can be deep inside, love can be suicide
Can't you see, you can't hide what you feel, when it's real
A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
But you know that your love is all you've got

A touch can mean so much when it's all you've got
But when she says she loves you that means a lot
Can't you see, yeah, can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah, can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah, can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah, can't you see, yeah


Well that'll be the day
When you say goodbye
Yeah that'll be the day
When you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave
You know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day
When I die

Well you give me all your loving
And all your turtle doving
All your hugs and kisses
And your money too
You say you love me baby
Still you tell me maybe
That somebody, well I'll be through

Well that'll be the day
When you say goodbye
That'll be the day
When you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave
You know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day
When I die

Yes that'll be the day
When you say goodbye
Yes that'll be the day
When you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave
You know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day
When I die

Well when Cupid shot his dart
He shot it at your heart
So if we'll ever part
And I'll leave you
You say and hold me
And you tell me boldly
That some day, well I'll be through

Well that'll be the day
When you say goodbye
Yes that'll be the day
When you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave
You know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day
When I die

Yeah that'll be the day
Ohoh that'll be the day
Ohoh that'll be the day
Ohoh that'll be the day

Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said
You've got to go back
You know they didn't even give us a chance

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown call to say
You can make it O.K.
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The newspapers said
Say what're you doing in bed
I said we're only trying to get us some peace

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
Oh boy when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you but your soul, think

Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspapers said
She's gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press
Said we wish you success
It's good to have the both of you back

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me


[Roll up! Roll up for the magical mystery tour!
Step right this way!]

Roll up, roll up for the magical mystery tour
Roll up, roll up for the mystery tour
The magical mystery tour is waiting to take you away
Waiting to take you away, take you today

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away

Wo wo I never realised what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

[Whoa!]

I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away

She's got a ticker to ride
She's got a ticker to ride
She's got a ticker to ride
And she don't care

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Do...

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
He's the all-American bullet-headed Saxon mother's son

All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes

All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce", his mommy butted in
"If looks could kill, it would have been us instead of him".

All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill? [x3]


Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make


Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round, oh oh oh, round round round round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Oh, round round round round, oh

I never knew that a day 
Like today lay before us. 
I've got the sun in my heart 
And my heart's in the sun. 

Skies are as bright 
As your eyes, 
The horizon is open. 
Love is the ceiling, 

Feelings are reelings 
Free as the air. 

Forever on and forever, 
Forever on side by side. 
Who ever knew that we two 
Could be free as we'd fancy, 

Fancy is free 
But are we bound 
To each other by love, 
To each other by love? 

Who ever knew that we two 
Could be free as we'd fancy, 
Fancy is free 
But are we bound 

To each other by love,

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
Without looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels 
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of your door
You can know all things on earth
Without looking out of your window
You could know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without traveling 
See all without looking
Do all without doing


The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door

The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Any way you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me waiting here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door

But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me waiting here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door


We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before
Now today I find you have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before

Last night is a night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did it makes me want to cry

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before
Now today I find you have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before

When I held you near you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before

Last night is a night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did, it makes me want to cry

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
Like the night before

"I'm the Sheik of Araby, 
Your love belongs to me.
At night when you're asleep 
Into your tent I'll creep.
The stars that shine above,
Will light our way to love.
You'll rule this land with me;


Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?

It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love

In the beginning I misunderstood
But now I've got it, the word is good

Spread the word and you'll be free
Spread the word and be like me
Spread the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?

It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love

Every where I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?

It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love

Now that I know what I feel must be right
I'm here to show everybody the light

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
It's the word I'm thinking of
And the only word is love

It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love

Say the word love
Say the word love
Say the word love
Say the word love


There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone

I think of you
And things you do
Go 'round my head
The things you said
Like "I love only you"

In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so

There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone
There's a place, there's a place, there's a place, there's a place

You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinking of me
Somehow I will know

Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
The things we said today

You say you'll be mine, girl
'Til the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find

Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
The things we said today

Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay
And that's enough
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on

Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay
And that's enough
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on

Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
The things we said today


I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you


That boy
Took my love away
He'll regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again

That boy
Isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again

Oh, and this boy would be happy 
Just to love you, but oh my 
That boy won't be happy
Till he's seen you cry

This boy
Wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again

This boy, this boy, this boy


Three cool cats, 
Three cool cats 
Are coming up in a beat up car, 
Spitting up a lift of candy bar 
Talking on about how sharp they are. 
Three cool cats. 

Three cool chicks 
Are walking down the street 
Swinging their hips, 
Splitting up a bag of potatoe chips 
I think cool cats really did flip. 
Three cool chicks

Well up came that first cool cat, 
He said: man look at that. 
Man, do you see what I see? 
Well I want that middle chick 
I want that little chick. 
Hey man save once chick for me. 

Well three cool chicks. 
Three cool chicks.

Angels from up above 
And three cool cats 
Really fell in love. 
But three cool chicks 
Made three fools out of 
Three cool cats. 
Three cool cats.

Is going away

She's got a ticket to ride,

There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
'Til there was you

There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
'Til there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
'Til there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
'Til there was you
'Til there was you

Turn off your mind relax and float down stream
It is not dying, it is not dying

Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void,
It is shining, it is shining.

Yet you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

Love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing

And ignorance and hate mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not leaving, it is not leaving

So play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning


Running to and fro, 
Hard working at the mill, 
Never failed at the mill, 
There come a rotten bill. 
Aw too much monkey business, 
Too much monkey business, 
Too much monkey business 
For me to be involved again. 

Salesman talking to me, 
Trying to run me up a creek, 
Says you can buy it, go on try it, 
You can pay me next week. 
Aw too much monkey business, 
Too much monkey business, 
Too much monkey business 
For me to be involved again. 

Blonde hair, good-looking, 
Trying to get me hooked and married 
Get a home, settle down by the book. 
Too much monkey business, 
Too much monkey business, 
Too much monkey business 
For me to be involved again. 

Been to Yokohama, baby, 
Fighting in the war, 
Army bunk, army chow, 
Army clothes, army car. 
Too much monkey business, 
Too much monkey business, 
Too much monkey business 
For me to be involved again. 

Same thing every day, 
Getting up, going to school. 
No need for me complaining, 
My objection's overruled. 
Aw too much monkey business, 
Too much monkey business, 
Too much monkey business 
For me to be involved again. 

Working in the filling station, 
Too many tasks, 
Wipe the windows, check the oil, 
Check the tires, dollar gas? 
Aw too much monkey business, 
Too much monkey business 
Don't want you by the race, 
Get away and leave me. 

[Original has one more verse: 
Pay-phone, something's wrong, 
Dime gone, will mail. 
Oughta sue the operator 
For telling me a tale. 
Too much monkey business, 
Too much monkey business, 
Too much monkey business 
For me to be involved with you.]


Well, shake it up baby now

Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's
Hard earned pay
Two of us Sunday driving
Not arriving

On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches

On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing so low
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere

On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home


It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

But if your heart breaks
Don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong
Hold on, I won't delay
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

I feel as though
You ought to know
That I've been good
As good as I can be
And if you do
I'll trust in you
And know that you
Will wait for me

It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

I feel as though
You ought to know
That I've been good
As good as I can be
And if you do
I'll trust in you
And know that you
Will wait for me

But if your heart breaks
Don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong
Hold on, I won't delay
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh, how I've been alone


Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
We can work it out
We can work it out

Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night
We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So, I will ask you once again
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long
We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long
We can work it out
We can work it out


What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind

The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind

I met you in the morning
Waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?

I used to think of no on else
But you were just the same
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind



Look what you're doing, I'm feeling blue and lonely,
Would it be too much to ask of you,
What you're doing to me?

You got me running and there's no fun in it,
Why should it be so much to ask of you,
What you're doing to me?

I've been waiting here for you,
Wond'ring what you're gonna do,
Should you need a love that's true,
It's me.

Please stop your lying, you've got me crying, girl,
Why should it be so much to ask of you,
What you're doing to me?

What you're doing to me.



Hey mama, don't you treat me wrong
Come and love your daddy all night long
All right, hey, hey, all right now

See the girl with the diamond ring
She knows how to shake that thing
All right, hey, hey, mmm, all right now

Ahhh, ohh, ahhh, ohh, ahhh, ohh, ohh

Make me feel so good, make me feel so good right now
Make me feel so good, make me feel so good right now
Make me feel so good, make me feel so good

Mmm, see the girl with the red dress on
She can do the dog all night long
All right, hmm what'd I say, tell me what'd I say

Tell me what'd I say, tell me what'd I say right now
Tell me what'd I say, tell me what'd I say right now
Tell me what'd I say, tell me what'd I say

Ahhh, ohh, ahhh, ohh, ahhh, ohh, ohh
It's all right, it's all right right now
Baby, it's all right, baby, it's all right right now
Baby, it's all right, oh yeah!

Baby shake that thing, baby shake that thing right now
Baby shake that thing, baby shake that thing right now
Baby shake that thing, well I feel all right

She looks as an African queen,
She tastes as Mongolian lamb.

Had a pain at the party. 
What a shame Mary Jane. 
What a shame Mary Jane 
Had a pain at the party. 
What a shame Mary Jane 
Had a pain at the party. 
What a shame Mary Jane. 
What a shame Mary Jane 
Had a pain at the party.

When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

I could be handy, mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight
If it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck 
Dave

Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Ho!

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps.

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you.

I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps.

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you.

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps.


Why why can't we love again? 
Why why are you shy on love? 
If you only knew how much I love you, 
Why can't you love me again? 

Why why don't you open your heart? 
Why why are we so far apart? 
If you only knew how much I love you, 
Why can't you love me again? 

I just want your loving arms around me, yeah, 
I got to find a way to make you take me back.

What would you think if I sang out of tune
Would you stand up and walk out on me
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Hmm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Hmm, going to try with a little help from my friends

What do I do when my love is away
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day
Are you sad because you're on your own?

No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Hmm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Hmm, going to try with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Hmm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Hmm, going to try with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody?
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Hmm, going to try with a little help from my friends
Oh, I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends


We were talking
About the space between us all
And the people
Who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth
Then it's far too late when they pass away

We were talking
About the love we all could share 
When we find it
To try our best to hold it there, with our love, with our love
We could save the world, if they only knew

Try to realize it's all within yourself, no-one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

We were talking
About the love that's gone so cold
And the people
Who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see
Are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you


We were talking, about the space between us all
And the people, who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away

We were talking, about the love we all could share 
When we find it, to try our best to hold it there, with our love
With our love we could save the world, if they only knew

Try to realize it's all within yourself, no-one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

We were talking, about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself 
Then you may find peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you


Woman, I can hardly express 
My mixed emotions and my thoughtlessness
After all, I'm forever in your debt
And woman, I will try to express my inner feelings and thankfulness
For showing me the meaning of success

Ooh, well, doo doo doo doo doo.
Ooh, well, well, doo doo doo doo doo

Woman, I know you understand the little child inside a man
Please remember, my life is in your hands, and woman
Hold me close to your heart, however distant don't keep us apart
After all it is written in the stars

Ooh, well 

Woman, please let me explain
I never meant to cause you sorrow or pain
So let me tell you again and again and again 
I love you, yeah, yeah, yeah, now and forever
I love you, yeah, yeah, yeah, now and forever


Hold me close and tell me how you feel
Tell me love is real
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling, I love you

Let me hear you say the words I long to hear
Darling, when you're near
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling, I love you

In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found a sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

(Full speed ahead Mr. Boatswain, full speed ahead
Full speed ahead it is, Sergeant.
Cut the cable, drop the cable
Aye, Sir, aye
Captain, captain)

As we live a life of ease
Every one of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine


[Instrumental]


Yes, I'm lonely
Want to die
Yes, I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already
Oh, girl, you know the reason why

In the morning
Want to die
In the evening
Want to die
If I ain't dead already
Oh, girl, you know the reason why

My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth

I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already
Oh, girl, you know the reason why

The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bone
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones

Lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already
Oh, girl, you know the reason why

Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll

Want to die
Yeah, want to die
If I ain't dead already
Oh, girl, you know the reason why


If you wear red tonight
Remember what I said tonight
For red is the color that my baby wore
And what is more, it's true
Yes it is

Scarlet were the clothes she wore
Everybody knows I'm sure
I would remember all the things we planned
Understand, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is

I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, yes it is
Oh, yes it is, yeah

Please don't wear red tonight
This is what I said tonight
For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is

I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, yes it is
Oh, yes it is, yeah

Please don't wear red tonight
This is what I said tonight
For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is, it's true


Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm


Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly, I'm not half to man I used to be,
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.


Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away

How can I even try?
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
"Love will find a way?"
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away


I got something to say that might cause you pain,
If I catch you talking to that boy again,
I'm gonna let you down,
And leave you flat,
Because I told you before, oh,
You can't do that

Well, it's the second time, I've caught you talking to him,
Do I have to tell you one more time, I think it's a sin,
I think I'll let you down,
Let you down and leave you flat,
Gonna let you down and leave you flat,
Because I've told you before, oh,
You can't do that

Everybody's green,
'Cause I'm the one, who won your love,
But if they'd seen,
You're talking that way they'd laugh in my face

So please listen to me, if you wanna stay mine,
I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind
I'm gonna let you down, let you down
And leave you flat,
Gonna let you down and leave you flat,
Because I've told you before, oh, you can't do that
You can't do that. You can't do that
You can't do that. You can't do that
You can't do that

Everybody's green,
'Cause I'm the one who won your love,
But if they'd seen,
You're talking that way they'd laugh in my face

So please listen to me, if you wanna stay mine,
I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind
I'm gonna let you down, let you down
And leave you flat,
Gonna let you down and leave you flat,
Because I've told you before, oh,
You can't do that

When I see you I just don't know what to say
I like to be with you every hour of the day
So if you want me
Just like I need you
You know what to do

I watched you walking by and you looked alone
I hope that you won't mind if I walk you back home
And if you want me
Just like I need you
You know what to do

Just call on me when you're lonely
I'll keep my love for you only
I'll call on you if I'm lonely too

Understand I'll stay with you every day
Make you love me more in every way
So if you want me
Just like I want you
You know what to do

Just call on me when you're lonely
I'll keep my love for you only
I'll call on you if I'm lonely too

Understand I'll stay with you every day
Make you love me more in every way
So if you want me
Just like I need you
You know what to do


Though you're gone away this morning
You'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time
If I just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

You've tried before to leave me
But you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely
Which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do

And it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me
I will follow you and bring
You back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it
I'll admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

'Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do

And it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me
I will follow you and bring
You back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it
I'll admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
'Cause you like me too much and I like you


You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, 
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go, nowhere to go

One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today (yes, it did)

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to Heaven


When I call you up, your line's engaged
I have had enough, so act your age
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me, you won't see me

I don't know why you should want to hide
But I can't get through, my hands are tied
I won't want to stay, I don't have much to say
But I get turned away
And you won't see me, you won't see me

Time after time you refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me, you won't see me

Time after time you refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
I just can't go on
If you won't see me, you won't see me


Well darling all the night 
You'll be mine and I know 
You'll be mine 
Till you die 
You'll be mine 
And so all the night
You'll be mine 
You'll be mine 
And the stars 
Always shine 
You'll be mine 
Oh my darling, when you burnt
that toast the other morning 
I, I looked into you eyes and 
I could see that National Health eyeball
and I love you, like I've never done, 
like I've never done before! 
Oh darling 
In your eyes 
And you'll be mine
You will be mine 
You'll be mine 
At the star and so 
You'll be mine


You're going to lose that girl
You're going to lose that girl
If you don't take her out tonight
She's going to change her mind
And I will take her out tonight
And I will treat her kind

You're going to lose that girl
You're going to lose that girl
If you don't treat her right, my friend
You're going to find her gone
'Cause I will treat her right, and then
You'll be the lonely one

You're going to lose that girl
You're going to lose that girl
You're going to lose
I'll make a point of taking her away from you
That's what you do, yeah
The way you treat her what else can I do?

You're going to lose that girl

I don't like you, but I love you,
Seems that I'm always thinking of you.
Oh, oh, oh, you treat me badly,
I love you madly, you really got a hold on me.
You really got a hold on me, baby,
I don't want you, but I need you,
Don't want to kiss you, but I need you.

Hold me, hold me, hold me.

saw her standing on the corner (Yip yip boom)
A yellow ribbon in her hair (Yip yip boom)
I couldn't stop myself from calling
Well look a-there, look a-there
Wow look a-there, well look a-there
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

I took one look and I was fractured (Yip yip boom)
I tried to walk but I was lame (Yip yip boom)
I tried to talk but I just stuttered
Well what's your name, what's your name
Well what's your name, well what's your name
Young blood, ah young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

A crazy stop, she was the top
I tried to follow her all the way home
Things went bad, I met her dad
He said, "You'd better leave my daughter alone"
Ow!

Well I tried to speak but I just stuttered (Yip yip boom)
I saw the rising of the sun (Yip yip boom)
And all along my heart was falling
While you're the one, you're the one
While you're the one, ah you're the one
Young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
Yeah young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood
I can't get you out of my mind.

Though she was born a long long time ago
Your mother should know (your mother should)

Stuck in a corner 
Are monkeys in cages 
That don't have a number 
To fight one another 

Try to recover 
Climb up the ladder 
Look up and you see birds 
Blind as each other 
How long can we suffer? 

We're as blind as each other 
On the cloud that you're sitting 
There's one born every minute 
So much to discover 
I've become a believer 

Sisters and brothers 
Who fight one another 
Will mourn and deceive us 
Will find us and keep us 

Take us or leave us 
How soon is now? yeah 
How long is never? 
I'm nothing but normal 
With something together 

Come on and stick together 
On the cloud that you're sitting 
There's one born every minute 
So much to discover 
I've become a believer


She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far
The snow came down
Get's colder day by day, I miss her

I hear children singing
It felt like Christmas time

In these frozen and silent nights
Sometimes in a dream, you appear
Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow sparkle

And our hearts were singing
It felt like Christmas time

2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go
2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go

She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far
The snow came falling now
Get's colder day by day, I miss you

I hear people singing
It felt like Christmas time

I hear people singing
It felt like Christmas time

I hear people singing
It felt like Christmas time

I hear people singing
It felt like Christmas time


Those who are dead, are not dead
They're just living in my head
And since I fell for that spell
I am living there as well
Oh,

Time is so short and I'm sure
There must be something more

Those who are dead, are not dead
They're just living in my head, oh
And since I fell for that spell
I am living there as well, oh

Time is so short and I'm sure
There must be something more.

You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close

You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close
You didn't get to heaven but you oh, oh,

Oh, oh,

Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living in my head
Oh


Maybe I'm just a ghost
Disappear when anybody's close
Go through you when you travel
Travel over near

Maybe I'm just a ghost
Emptied by 'em, anybody knows
Maybe I'm on a rose
Or am I even here?

Yeah! 

Every time I try to walk through walls
More walls appear
What's the point of feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here?
What's the point of trying to raise your voice
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

Maybe I'm a ghost
Just a whisper in a path of smoke
A secret that nobody knows
No one will ever hear

Oh, maybe I'm a ghost
Specter on a roller coast
Fallen out of rose
Something people fear

Yeah! 

And every time I thought I walk through walls
It's all become clear
What's the point of feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here?
What's the point saying "Rescue me!"
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

And every time I thought I walk through walls
It's all become clear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear


Maybe I'm just a ghost
Disappear when anybody's close
Go through you when you travel
Travel over near

Maybe I'm just a ghost
Emptied by 'em, anybody knows

Oh, I think I've landed
In a world I hadn't seen
When I'm feeling ordinary
When I don't know what I mean

Oh, I think I've landed
Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds

And say it's true
It's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams

And you get a head
A head full of dreams
You can see the change you want to
Be what you want to be

When you get a head
A head full of dreams
It's a love, I've just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

Oh, I think I've landed
Where there are miracles at work
There you've got me open handed
When you got a lost of words

I sing, oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
A head full of dreams
Oh
Oh
Oh
A head full of dreams
Oh
It's a love, I've just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams


[Instrumental]


My song is love
Love to the lovers shone
And it goes up
You don't have to be alone

Your heavy heart
Is made of stone
And it's so hard to see you, clearly 
You don't have to be on your own
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I'll get that message home

My song is love
My song is love I know
And I'm on fire for you, clearly 
You don't have to be alone
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
But I'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home

And I'm not gonna stand and wait
Not gonna leave it until its much too late
On a platform I'm gonna stand and say
That I'm nothing on my own
And I love you, please come home

My song is love, is love I know
And I've got to get that message home


He said I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down
I'm gonna put it six feet underground
He said I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall
Stand here beside me baby, in the crumbling walls
Oh, I'm gonna buy this place and start a fire
Stand here until I fill all your heart's desires
Because I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn
Do back the things it did to you in return

Ah, ah, ah, ah

He said I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
Oh, and I'm gonna buy this place, that's what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head

Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without a trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They said start as you mean to go on
Start as you mean to go on

He said I'm gonna buy this place and see it go
Stand here beside my baby, watch the orange glow
Some'll laugh and some just sit and cry
You just sit down there and you wonder why
So I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
And I'm gonna buy this place, that's what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
Oh, to the head

Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without a trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They say start as you mean to go on
As you mean to go on, as you mean to go on

So meet me by the bridge, meet me by the lane
When am I gonna see that pretty face again
Meet me on the road, meet me where I said
Blame it all upon
A rush of blood to the head


'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
'Cause you light up the path

I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you

'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I wanna die in your arms
'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
I'm gonna give you my heart

I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you
I think I see you

'Cause you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view


As far as I can see
All time and circuitry
Is wrong

As far as poetry
Sit down and sing to me
A song

Cos' all I want in this world
All I want in this world
Is for you to come home

A spell a rebel yell
A spell

Soldier come home to me
You've been away from me
So long

All I want in this world
All I want and deserve
Is for you to come home

A spell a rebel yell (8x)


A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Remember your face
Who remembers you when you are gone?

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me
Look for me when I am lost

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

Night turns to day
And I still have these questions
Bridges will break
Should I go forwards or backwards?
Night turns to day
And I still get no answers

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Remember your face
Who remembers you when you are gone?

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me
Look for me when I am lost

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah


Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
We are legends, every day
That's what she told him

Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds

I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart beneath my skin
I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Said I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream, I die by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me

I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart beneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds taking shape
We are diamonds taking shape
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)

If we've only got this life
This adventure oh then  I
If we've only got this life
You'll get me through, oh
If we've only got this life
And this adventure, oh then I
Wanna share it with you
With you, with you
Sing it, oh, say yeah!

(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)


We were just about to lose our home
Diamonds ate the radio
Moving in the dead of night
We took photographs just some just so
History someone to know
We were moving at the speed of flight

Kids cry
If you want to
That's alright
If you want to
Hold me
Hold me tight

Just an alien

We were hovering without a home
Millions are UFO
Hovering in hope some scope tonight
Sees the light and says

Fly if you want to
That's alright
But if you want to
Call me
Call this line

Just an alien
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again

Tell your leader
Sir or ma'am
We come in peace
We mean no harm
Somewhere out there
In the unknown
All the E.T.'s are phoning home
Watching my life
On the skyline
Crossing your eyes
All a lifetime

Just an alien (moving target)
Target movement
Oh, we just want to get home again
Of the space time
Turning forward
Turning pages
Over Asia
Crossing ages
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again


Fish fell out of water
Bird stuck on the ground
Chaos giving orders
Everything is upside down
Whole world's gonna fly by
I wonder where they'll go, oh
Trouble's on the outside, I know
So now, all I can think about is you

All I can think about is you
We fall in a wonderland
So low
A wonderland for you
I wanna walk into

It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can do
It's all I can do
All I can think about is you
It's all I can
All I can think about is you
It's all I can
All I can think about is you
Love is the only thing that is true


On and on
You're told which side you're on
You're forced, you're thrown
To become side as to cut the corn

Aah
And all your friends they
Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away they blow

And all your friends they
Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away they're thrown
Into the fire

Ten below
The call come on the radio
Ahh
Over you go
And the red now all the rivers flow
The poppies grow

All your friends they
Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away they're blown

All your friends they
Ride into the sunset
Arrive into the sunset
And they're taken home

Open fire
Open fire

Open fire
Open fire
Open fire
And fire
Just arrived, the fire


I think of you
I haven't slept
I think I do
But I don't forget
My body moves
Goes where I will
But though I try my heart stays still
It never moves
Just won't be led
And so my mouth waters to be fed
And you're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head

You're always in my head
Always in my head
Always in my

This, I guess
Is to tell you you're chosen out from the rest


I think of you
I haven't slept
I think I do
But I don't forget
My body moves
Goes where I will
But though I try my heart stays still
It never moves
Just won't be led
And so my mouth waters to be fed
And you're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head

You're always in my head
Always in my head
Always in my

This, I guess
Is to tell you you're chosen out from the rest


Sat on a roof
Named every star
Shed every bruise and
Showed every scar

Hope has its proof
Your hand in mine, singing
Life has a beautiful, crazy design
And time seemed to say
Forget the world and its weight
And here I just wanna say

Amazing day
Amazing day

Sat on a roof
Named every star and
Showed me a place
Where you can be who you are

And the view
The whole Milky Way
In your eyes
I'm drifting away
And in your arms
I just wanna sway

Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day

And I asked every book
Poetry and chime
Can there be breaks
In the chaos of the times?
Oh, thanks God
You must've heard when I prayed
Because now I always
Want to feel this way

Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
It's today


Come on, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
If I, if I'd only waited
I'd not be stuck here in this hole

Come here, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
And I swear I waited and waited
I've got to get out of this hole

But time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
It's no cause for concern

Come on, oh my star is fading
And I see no chance of release
And I know I'm dead on the surface
But I am screaming underneath

And time is on your side
Is on your side, It's on your side now
Not pushing you down, and all around
No it's no cause for concern

Stuck on the end of this ball and chain
And I'm on my way back down again
Stood on a bridge, tied to the noose
Sick to the stomach
You can say what you mean
But it won't change a thing
I'm sick of the secrets
Stood on the edge, tied to the noose

You came along and you cut me loose
You came along and you cut me loose
You came along and you cut me loose


Animals we are
Disposable
Collapsible and raw
I suppose
It's just the state I'm in
Animals that climb
I'm climbin' over you
Until you say
"Off you go, off you go"

Animal I am
Disposable
Collapsible and raw
I don't know which way
I should turn

Animal that runs
I ran away from you
And now I'm in
"Off you go, off you go"
(And you say)

If you're gonna go, go now
If you're gonna go, go now
I forgot to tell you how
If you gonna go, go now

Animal I am
I'm looking for a future
Just like you
Well I don't know
Which way I turn

Animals that climb
I climb all over you
Until I say
And I missed my chance
By a stone slow

If you're gonna go
Go now
If you're gonna go
Go now
I forgot to tell you how
If you gonna go
Go now


Late night watching TV
Used to be you here beside me
Used to be your arms around me
Your body on my body

When the world means nothing to me
Another's arms, another's arms
When the pain just rips right through me
Another's arms, another's arms

Late night watching TV
Used to be you here beside me
Is there someone there to reach me?
Or someone there to find me

When the pain just rips right through me
Another's arms, another's arms
And this's just torture to me
Another's arms, another's arms

Pull yourself into me
Another's arms, another's arms
Love means nothing to me
Another's arms, another's arms

Got to pull you close into me
Another's arms, another's arms
Pull yourself right through me
Another's arms, another's arms

Late night watching TV
Wish that you were here beside me
Wish that your arms were around me
Your body on my body


Been around the world, wonders to view
Been around the world, looking for someone like you
Pyramids try, babylon too
But the beautiful-est treasures lie in the deepest blue

So I'll never say die, I'm never untrue
I'm never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire, that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is going to fight for you

Been around the world, universe too
I've been around flying, baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do
Dance with the stars, while I see the moon
I'll be standing there besides you
Right when the storm comes through

'Cause I'll never say die, I'm never untrue
I'm never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire, that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is going to fight for you
My army of one is going to fall for you, yeah

'Cause you're right, 'cause you're right
'Cause you're right
My army of one is gonna call it through

Say my heart is my gun, army of one
Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one
Is my only weapon, army of one
Say my heart is my gun, army of one

(So I race for it)
Stare into darkness, staring at doom
My heart boom, bo-boom boom
Stare into darkness, admit defeat
Coming home and I'm finding no peace

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm out of luck
And I know, and I know and I know
I know what you've got

So I put my hands up to the sky, feel alive
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
I put my hands up to the sky, it's all right
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

(So I race for it) wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I race for it)

Stare into darkness, staring at doom
You make my heart go boom, bo-boom boom
Superhero, a masterpiece
Been in a city but it centered around me

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm in luck
And I know, and I know and I know
I know when I'm not

I just put my hands up to the sky, feel alive
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
I put my hands up to the sky, feel it inside
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

I just put my hands up to the sky, feeling alright
I've got a rocket, eyes on the prize
I put my hands up to the sky, I'm gonna find
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

(So I reach for it) wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I reach for it)yeah yeah wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I reach for it) and I know, and I know, and I know 
(So I reach for it) I know what I've got
X marks the spot
So I put my hands up to the sky,  feeling alright
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
I put my hands up to the sky, the feeling is like
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

I put my hands up to the sky, feeling alright
I've got a rocket, eyes on the price
I put my hands up to the sky, I'm gonna fly
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure, yeah yeah wherever you are


Some saw the sun
Some saw the smoke
Some heard the gun
Some bent the bow

Sometimes the wire must tense for the note
Caught in the fire, say oh
We're about to explode

Carry your world, I'll carry your world
Carry your world, I'll carry your world

Some far away
Some search for gold
Some dragon to slay
Heaven we hope is just up the road

Show me the way, Lord, 'cause I, I'm about to explode

Carry your world, I'll carry your world
Carry your world, I'll carry your world

Carry your world, and all your hurt

(Carry your world, carry your world)


I want to be bigger stronger drive a faster car
To take me anywhere in seconds
To take me anywhere I want to go
And drive around a faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less

I want to be bigger stronger drive a faster car
At the touch of a button
I can go anywhere I want to go
And drive around my faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less

I think I want to change my attitude
I think I want to change my oxygen
I think I want to change my air
My atmosphere
I want to choke

I want to be bigger stronger drive a faster car
To take me anywhere in seconds
To take me anywhere I want to go
And drive around my faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less

I think I need to change my attitude
I think I want to change my oxygen
I think I want to change my air
My atmosphere
I want to choke

Bigger better
Bigger and better
Bigger and better
Bigger stronger drive a faster car
At the touch of a button
I can go anywhere I want to go


Standing in the corner
Studying the lights
Dreaming of escape
Could be up at night

Someone put the fares up
Got me in raise
So guess it's better to stay

Well, come on and say
Well, the food's gonna find us
Just the water and rain
Don't let the fear install
I wanna see you again
I hear you never wanna, sleep all night
Just not falling in love
Stop the ride, come on rage with me

Don't need notes
We'll be birds
To make you look in

Look up this morning
You and me
Get you off your feet

Come on, raise it
Come on raise this noise
One million people, and not one voice
Come on, it's not over
For me, sing loud
Come on, awful love, come away with me
We don't need words

Close your eyes and see
The lumpy boats
Falling free
Fall in love and I missed you

Free as free and free
We'll go through this together
Fly won't you
Won't you take me too?
In this world so cruel
I think you're so cool


Chris Martin :
This is probably the best song ever written  And he's the best singer in the world, Mr. Richard Ashcroft. Ok, here we go: 

'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, this life 
Tryin' to make ends meet 
You're a slave to money then you die 
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down 
You know the one that takes you to the places 
where all the veins meet, yeah 

You know I can't change, I can change 
I can change, I can change 
But I'm here in my mold 
I am here in my mold 
But I'm a million different people 
from one day to the next 
I can't change my mold 
No, no, no, no, no 
Have you ever been down?, have you ever been down? 

Well I never pray 
But tonight I'm on my knees, yeah 
I need to hear some sounds 
that recognize the pain in me, now 
I let the melody shine, 
let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now 
But the airways are clean and there's nobody singing to me now 

You know i can't change, I can change 
I can change, I can change 
But I'm here in my mold 
I am here in my mold 
But I'm a million different people 
from one day to the next 
I can't change my mold 
No, no, no, no, no 
Have you ever been down?, have you ever been down? 

'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, this life 
Tryin' to make ends meet 
You're a slave to money then you die 
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down 
You know the one that takes you to the places 
where all the veins meet yeah 

You know i can't change, I can change 
I can change, I can change 
But I'm here in my mold 
I am here in my mold 
But I'm a million different people 
from one day to the next 
I can't change my mold 
No, no, no, no, no 
Have you ever been down?, have you ever been down? 

I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down

My life 
Your life 
Their lives 

Come take it down the only road I've ever been down 
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, yeah 
This life, this life, this life... 

Thank you . . .


People wanna fight for fun
But what is a battle when the war's already been won
People wanna break what's built
There's no use crying when the milk's already been spilt
Here's a needle, here's a thread
Sew yourself up, clear your head
Here's a needle, here's a thread
Oh no, I meant exactly what I said

You might find that you're useless
No better than a hole in the ground
You might find that you're useless
No better than a hole in the ground

Look at all the cavemen goin'
Turning over to the shore
Ohhh

I'm only looking for a bloodless revolution
I'm only looking for a bloodless revolution
I'm only looking for a bloodless revolution


When you're sitting on a beach in a car with the paint dried up
Well, you're gonna give a cause when the rain washed up
Well being just there with the gypsy talking to my friend
But you'll never get with it if you don't get respect
Oh well you'll never get with it if you just want respect

But sometimes the money's gonna run out
And you'll be standing on the corner with a belly full of doubt
Sometimes somebodys gonna bring you down
And you'll be standing on your own with a bucket for a crown

Well me and the boys were standing thinking we were hip
I don't wanna be the captain of a sinking ship
Well me and the boys in a town where the mormon go
Listening to a session by noel gallagher
I was listening to a session by noel gallagher

They said sometimes your money's gonna run out
And you'll be standing on a corner with a belly full of doubt
Oh someday somebody's gonna bring you down
And you'll be standing on a corner with a bucket for a crown
Oh you'll be standing on a corner
Just waiting on a corner
Standing on a corner with a bucket for a crown

Every night 
Every day
Just to be there in your arms 
Won't you stay 
Won't you stay 
Stay forever and ever and ever, ah, ah

I feel safe
I feel warm
When you're here, can I do no wrong?
I am cured, when I'm by you're side
I'm alright, yes I'm alright

I'm safe when I am with you
And I feel warm if you want me to
I am cured, when I'm by your side
I'm alright

Careful where you stand, my love
Careful where you lay your head
It's true we're always there
Looking out for one another

I feel safe when I'm with you
And I feel warm if you want me to
I am cured when you're all alone
I'm alright

Careful where you stand, my love
Careful where you lay your head
It's true we're always there
Looking out for one another

So I'd like a quiet town, please
I'd like a quiet town

Oh now now
Oh now now
And careful where you stand
And careful where you stand


At night they would go walking 'till the breaking of the day
The morning is for sleeping
Through the dark streets, they go searching, to see God in their own way
Save the nighttime for your weeping
Your weeping

Singing la lalalalala la la
And the night over London lay

So we rode down to the river, where the toiling ghosts spring
For their curses to be broken
We'd go underneath the arches, where the witches are in the saying
There are ghost towns in the ocean
The ocean

Singing la lalalalala la la
And the night over London lay

God is in the houses and God is in my head
And all the cemeteries in London
I see God come in my garden, but I don't know what he said
For my heart it wasn't open
Not open

Singing la lalalalala la la
And the night over London lay
Singing la lalalalala la la
There's no light over London today.


Stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free

I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
I saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

In my scarecrow dreams
When they smashed my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete
Be the cartoon heart

Light a fire, light a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart

We'll run wild oh
We'll be glowing in the dark
We'll be glowing in the dark

All the boys, all the girls
All that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls
All that matters that occurs
All the highs, all the lows
As the room is spinning, oh

We'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark

Living innocent wild
We'll be glowing in the dark

Christmas night, another fight
Tears we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood

I took my feet
To Oxford Street
Trying to right a wrong
Just walk away
Those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Up above candles on air flicker
Oh they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope

Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

Oh when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on

Oh Christmas lights
Light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas lights keep shining on


The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of the things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing

You are, you are

Confusion that never stops
The closing walls and the ticking clocks gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop, that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities am I
A part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease, singing

You are, you are
You are, you are
You are, you are

And nothing else compares
And nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

You are, you are

Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)
Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)


Because each has been sent
As a guide


It could be worse, I could be alone
I could be locked in here on my own

Or like a stone that suddenly drops
It never stops, no

I could be lost or I could be saved
Calling out from beneath the waves
Beaten down by the social raves

Never again; never again

Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I'm screamin' out from the crests of waves

It could be worse; it's all sweet
It could be snapped from the jaws of defeat
Or like a light lit up on the beach
You wear your heart on your sleeve, Ohhhh

You want to stop before you begin
You want to sink when you know you could swim
You want to stop just before you begin
Never give in; never give in

Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I'm screamin' out from the crests of waves

Oooooo Nothin' matters
Except not for the love we make
Ooooooooooo

Nothin' matters
Ooooooooooo
Except not for the love we make

Nothin' matters
Ooooooooooo
Except not for the love we make

Aaaahhhhhh
Except not for the love we make

Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I'm screamin' out from the crests of waves

Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I'm screamin' out from the crests of waves
Where you're longing to be saved

I'm screamin' out from the crests of waves
Where you're longing to be saved
I'm screamin' out from the crests of waves


To my surprise, and my delight
I saw sunrise, I saw sunlight
I am nothing in the dark
And the clouds burst to show daylight

Oh and the sun will shine
Yeah on this heart of mine
Oh and I realize
Who cannot live without
Oh come apart without
It

On a hilltop, on a sky-rise
Like a firstborn child
And at full tilt, and in full flight
Defeat darkness, breaking daylight

Oh and the sun will shine
Yeah on this heart of mine
Oh and I realized
Who cannot live without
Oh and come apart without
Daylight

(Slowly breaking through daylight)


All winter we got carried away
Over on the rooftops, let's get married
All summer we just hurried
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry

So come over, just be patient, and don't worry
And don't worry

Try
Try
Try
Try

No, I don't want to battle from beginning to end
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
I don't want to follow Death and all of his friends

No, I don't want to battle from beginning to end
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
I don't want to follow Death and all of his friends

And, in the end, we lie awake, and we dream of making our escape
And, in the end, we lie awake, and we dream of making our escape


If sweet death should ever come for me
Let me know, boys, let me know
If you hear him coming, won't you let me flee
Let me go, boys, let me go 


One day death is gonna conquer me
I'll be down where the waters flow
I hope sweet heaven is the place for me
Let me know, boys, let me know


If sweet death should ever come for me
Take me down to some place below
If you hear him coming won't you set me free
Let me go, boys, let me go 


If you hear him coming, won't you sing for me?
That I just don't want to go.



And if I lost the map
If I lost it all
Or fell into the trap
Then she'd call
'When you're tired of racing
And you find you never left the start
Come on baby
Don't let it break your heart'

Though heavily we bled
Still on we crawl
Try to catch a cannonball
And a slowly burning tide, oh
Through my veins is flowing
From my shipwreck I heard her call

She said 'When you're tired of aiming your arrows
Still you never hit the mark, oh
Even in your rains and shadows
Still we're never going to part
Come on baby
Don't let it break your heart, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't let it break your heart, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't let it break your heart

Don't let it break your heart


Bones sinking like stones
All that we've fought for
Homes, places we've grown
All of us are done for

We live in a beautiful world
Yeah we do

We live in a beautiful world

Bones sinking like stones

Love, I hope we get on 
I hope we can find a way 
Seeing it all 
Love, I hope we can be 
I hope I can find a way 
Of letting you see 
That I'm so easy to please 
So easy 

Love, I hope we grow up 
I hope we can find a way 
Of seeing it all 
Love, I hope we can be 
I hope I can find a way 
Of letting you see 
That I'm so easy to please 
So easy


We see people coming
See people go
This particular timing is extra special
I know you might be gone
And the world may not know
Still, I see you celestial

Like a lion you ran
Goddess, he wrote
Like an eagle, you circle
Perfect of all
So how come things move on?
How come cars don't slow?
When it feels like the end of the world
When I should but I can't let you go

But when I'm cold, cold
When I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me
When I'm in shadows
There's a feeling of ever, everglow

We're brothers in that
The sisters you write
When we stroll on like that
Be friends 'til we die
With the changing of winds
And the way waters flow
Life is shortest in fall, in the snow
I know I'm going to miss you, I know

But when I'm cold, cold
Yeah, all alone, the sun
And I know that you're with me
And the way you will show, when you're with me wherever I go
But you give me this feeling, it's everglow

What I wouldn't give for this moment to hold
Yeah, I live for this feeling, it's everglow

So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow


Well, they say people come
The say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know
Still I see you, celestial

And I should but I can't let you go
But when I'm cold, I'm cold
Yeah, when I'm cold
Cold
There's a light that you give me when I'm in shadow
There's a feeling within me, an everglow

Like brothers in blood, or sisters who ride
Yeah we swore on that night we'd be friends 'til we die
But the changing of winds, and the way waters flow
Life is short as the falling of snow
And I'm gonna miss you, I know

But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know that you're with me and the way you will show
And you're with me wherever I go
And you give me this feeling, this everglow

What I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Because, I live for this feeling, this everglow

So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow

God is watching me
God is, God don't praise me because I be Joe Fraiser
God don't give nothin' 'bout Joe Fraiser
God don't care nothin' about England or America as far as
Your wealth is all his
He wants to know how do we treat each other, how do we help each other
So, I'm gonna dedicate my life to using my name and popularity to helping charities
Helping people, unite with people bring people bombing each other because of religious beliefs
We need somebody in the world to help us all make peace
So when I die, if there's a heaven I'm gonna see it


I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favourite song

And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up
I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop

Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

As we saw oh this light I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall
Oh
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh
Is a is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh

So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still I'll raise the flag

Oh
It was a wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall
A wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall


When I'm counting up my demons
Saw there was one for every day
With the good ones on my shoulder
I drove the other ones away

If you ever feel neglected
If you think all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

When you thought that it was over
You could feel it all around
Everybody's out to get you
Don't you let it drag you down

'Cause if you ever feel neglected
If you think that all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

If you ever feel neglected
If you think all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

Singing out
Oh oh oh yeah, oh oh yeah, oh oh yeah
Everything's not lost

Come on yeah oh oh yeah come on yeah
Everything's not lost

Oh oh oh yeah oh oh yeah oh oh yeah
And everything's not lost

Come on yeah oh oh yeah come on yeah
Come on yeah oh oh yeah come on yeah
Everything's not lost

Sing out yeah oh oh yeah come on yeah
Everything's not lost

Come on yeah oh oh yeah sing out yeah
Everything's not lost

Now I never meant to do you wrong
But that's what I came here to say
But if I was wrong, then I'm sorry
I don't let it stand in our way
'Cause my head just hates when I think of
The things that I shouldn't have done
But life is for living, we all know
And I don't wanna live it alone

Sing out, ah ah
Sing ah ah ah
And just sing ah ah ah ah ah


I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sweep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing:
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of sand, pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait

For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter will call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
(Oh, oh, oh)

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter will call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Oh, oh, oh


When you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

When the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

High up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
If you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I

Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from all my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you


A flock of birds hovering above
Just a flock of birds, 
That's how you think of love
And I always look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
They fly on

A flock of birds hovering above
Into smoke, I'm turned and rise
Following them up
Still I always look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive
Next, you know they're gone
They fly on

Fly on, oh
So fly on
Ride through
Maybe one day, I'll fly next to you
Fly on
Ride through
Maybe one day, I can fly with you
Fly on
Fly on
Fly on


If you're lost and feel alone
Circumnavigate the globe
All you ever have to hope for two

And the way you seem to float
Circumnavigate in hope
And they seem to lose control
With you

Everyone of us is hurt
And everyone of us is scarred
Everyone of us is scared
Not you

Your eyes closed
Your head hurts
Your eyes feel so low

Everyone of us is scared
Everyone of us is hurt
Everyone of us has hope

For you
X10


I know it's over before she says
I know it falls at the water face
I know it's over, an ocean awaits
For a storm
The sun and snow
Rivers and rain
Crystal ball could foresee a change
And I know it's over, parting our ways
And it's done

But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh-oh-oh
From the top of the world
Top of the waves
You said forever, forever always
We could have been lost
We would have been saved
Oh, I-aaah
Now we're stopping the world, stopping it's spin
Oh come on don't give up
You see me give in
Don't say it's over
Don't say we're done
Oh, didn't we have fun?
Woo-oh-oh-oh
Woo-oh-oh-oh
Woo-oh-oh-oh
Oh, didn't we have fun?

I know it's over before she says
Now someone else has taken your place
I know it's over Icarus says to the sun
And so it sinks in, lightning strikes
You're too forced to force his glide
The fact that it's over, the fact that it's done
Ah-ah-ah

Didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh-oh
From the top of the world
Top of the waves
You said forever, forever always
We could have been lost
We would have been saved
Oh, I-aaah
Now we're stopping the world, stopped it in its tracks
Nothing's too broken to find our way back
So before it's over, before you run
Ah, didn't we have fun?

Just you and me
We were always meant to, always meant to
Be
We were always meant to, always meant to
You and me
We were always meant to, always meant to
Be
Oh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, didn't we have fun?
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, didn't we have fun?
But didn't?
Maybe we could again


Maybe I'm just a ghost
Disappear when anybody's close
Go through you when you travel
Travel over near

Maybe I'm just a ghost
Emptied by 'em, anybody knows
Maybe I'm on a rose
Or am I even here?

Yeah! 

Every time I try to walk through walls
More walls appear
What's the point of feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here?
What's the point of trying to raise your voice
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

Maybe I'm a ghost
Just a whisper in a path of smoke
A secret that nobody knows
No one will ever hear

Oh, maybe I'm a ghost
Specter on a roller coast
Fallen out of rose
Something people fear

Yeah! 

And every time I thought I walk through walls
It's all become clear
What's the point of feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here?
What's the point saying "Rescue me!"
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

And every time I thought I walk through walls
It's all become clear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear


Scared of losing all the time
He wrote it in a letter
He was a friend of mine
He heard you could see your future
Inside a glass of water
With ripples and the rhymes
He asked will I see heaven in mine?

Oh that is just the way it was
And nothing could be better
And nothing ever was
And they say you can see your future
Inside a glass of water
With riddles and the rhymes
But will I see heaven in mine?
Oh, oh, oh

Son, don't ask,
Neither how full nor empty is your glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living in the past
Going nowhere fast

So he wrote it on a wall
The hollowest of halos
Is no halo at all
And Televisions selling plastic figurines of leaders
Saying nothing at all
And you chime
Stars in heaven align
Oh

Son, don't ask,
Neither how full nor empty is your glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living in the past
Going nowhere fast

What are we drinking when we're done, just glasses of water


Where do we go nobody knows?
I've gotta say I'm on my way down
God give me style and give me grace
God put a smile upon my face

Where do we go to draw the line?
I've gotta say
I wasted all your time, honey honey
Where do I go to fall from grace?
God put a smile upon your face
Yeah

Now when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah when you work it out I wanted to
Now when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

Where do we go nobody knows?
Don't ever say you're on your way down when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face
Ah yeah

Now when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah when you work it out I wanted to
Now when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
As good as mine
As good as mine
As good as mine
As good as mine

Where do we go nobody knows?
Don't ever say you're on your way down when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face


I know it doesn't seem that way
But maybe it's the perfect day
Even though the bills are piling
Maybe Lady Luck ain't smiling

But if we'd only open our eyes
We'd see the blessings in disguise
That all the rain clouds are fountains
Though our troubles seem like mountains

There's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills
So don't lose heart
Give the day a chance to start

Every now and then life says
Where do you think you're going so fast
We're apt to think it cruel but sometimes
It's a case of cruel to be kind

And if we'd get up off our knees
Well then we'd see the forest for the trees
And we'd see the new sun rising
Over the hills and horizon

There's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills
So don't lose faith
Give the world a chance to say...

A word or two, my friend
There's no telling how the day might end
And we'll never know until we see
That there's gold in them hills

There's gold in them hills
So don't lose heart
Give the day a chance to start

There's gold in them hills...
There's gold in them hills...


Honey
It's been a long time coming
And I can't stop now
Such a long time running
And I can't stop now

Do you hear my heart beating
Can you hear that sound
'Cause I can't help thinking
That I don't look down

And then I looked up at the sun
And I could see
The way that gravity turns for you and me
And then I looked up at the sky
And saw the sun
And the way that gravity turns on everyone
On everyone

Baby
It's been a long time waiting
Such a long, long time
And I can't stop smiling
No I can't stop now

Do you hear my heart beating
Oh do you hear that sound
'Cause I can't stop crying
And I won't look down

And then I looked up at the sun 
And I could see
Oh the way that gravity turns 
On you and me
And then I looked at the sun 
And saw the sky
And the way that gravity pulls on you and I
On you and I


Honey you are a rock
Upon which I stand
And I come here to talk
I hope you understand

That green eyes
Yeah the spotlight, shines upon you
And how could anybody deny you

I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter
Now I met you
And honey you should know
That I could never go on without you
Green eyes

Honey you are the sea
Upon which I float
And I came here to talk
I think you should know

That green eyes
You're the one that I wanted to find
And anyone who tried to deny you
Must be out of their mind

Because I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter
Since I met you
And honey you should know
That I could never go on without you

Green eyes
Green eyes
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Honey you are the rock
Upon which I stand


So I heard you say,
I got your getaway.
I'm on a second trail,
As clear as crystal. 

But it was harmless,
It couldn't hurt you.
Oh you were helpless,
I know you'll get through.


Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Can anybody fly this thing
Before my head explodes
Or my head starts to ring

We've been living life
Inside a bubble
We've been living life
Inside a bubble

Confidence in you
Is confidence in me
Is confidence in high speed

Can anybody stop this thing
Before my head explodes
Or my head starts to ring

We've been living life
Inside a bubble
We've been living life
Inside a bubble

Confidence in you
Is confidence in me
Is confidence in high speed

High speed
High speed

High speed you on
High speed you on
High speed you on
High speed you on


Are you missing something?
Looking for something?
Tired of everything
Searching and struggling
Are you worried about it?
Do you wanna talk about it?
Oh You're gonna get it right some time

There's so much to be scared of
And not much to make sense of
Are you running in a circle?
You can't be too careful
And you can't relate it
'Cause it's complicated
Oh You're gonna get it right some time
You're gonna get it right some time

It's how you see the world
How many times can you see?
You can't believe what you learn

It's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
Your not gonna get hurt

Oh

Is there something missing?
There's nobody listening
Are you scared of what you don't know?
don't wanna end up on your own?
You need conversation
And information

Oh

Gonna get it right sometimes
You just wanna get it right sometimes

It's how you see the world
How many times have you heard?
You can't believe a word

It's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
'Cause nobody can learn

Oh
Oh
Oh

That's how you see the world
That's how you see the world


Anything we should know about your change? 
They put the world in a tin can, 
Black market, contraband, 
And it hurt just a little bit, when they sliced and packaged it. 
In a long black trench coat, 
Two hands around the throat, 
Ooh you want to get it right sometimes 

There's so much to be scared of, 
And not much to make sense of, 
How did the clowns ever get control? 
If your hear can you let me know, 
How can they invade it, when it's so complicated? 
Ooh you just want to get it right sometimes 
You just want to get it right sometimes 

That's how you see the world, 
How many times can you say, you can't believe what you learn, 
That's how you see the world, don't you worry yourself, 
You're not gonna give up. 

And there's something missing, seems like there's nobody listening, 
If you're running in a circle, how can you be too careful? 
We don't wanna be man trapped, we don't wanna be shrink wrapped 
Ooh, we just want to get it right sometimes, 
Just want to get it right sometimes, 

That's how you see the world, 
How many times have you heard, but you can't believe a word, 
That's how you see the world, but don't you worry yourself, 
'Cause nobody can hurt you 

That's how you see the world 
That's how you see the world


Here I am
And beyond the reach of my hands
She sounds asleep and she's sweeter now
Than the wildest dreams
Could have seen her
And I Watch her slipping away
And I know I'll be hunting high and low

High
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to
High and low
High
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to

Find her again
Upon this my dreams are depending
Through the dark
I can hear the pounding of her heart
Next to mine
She's the sweetest love I could find
So I know I'll be hunting high and low

High
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to
High and Low
High
Do you know how it feels to love you
Do you know how it feels to love you
High and low


Written in graffiti on a bridge in a park
Do you ever get the feeling
That you're missing the mark?
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold

Written up in marker on a factory sign
I struggle with the feeling
That my life isn't mine
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold

See the arrow that they shot trying
To tear us apart took the fire from my belly and
The beat from my heart
Still I won't let go
Still I won't let go

You, ooh, ooh
Oh you, use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

On every street, every car, every surface in nature
And at the streets are rising and you'd rather sing
Don't let them take control
No, we won't let 'em take control

Yes, I feel a little bit nervous
Yes, I feel nervous and I cannot relax
I'm coming 'round to get us
I'm coming 'round when they don't know the facts

So on a concrete canvas and a glow in the dark
On a concrete canvas, I will make you a mark
Armed with the spray can soul
Let me out with the spray can soul

You, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

'Cause you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

Yeah, it's true, when you
Use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

Oh and it hurts like heaven


Drink from me, drink from me (oh-ah-oh-ah)
Then we'll shoot across the (symphony)
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Drink from me, drink from me (oh-ah-oh-ah)
Then we'll shoot across the (oh-ah-oh-ah)
Symphony
(So high, so high)
Then we'll shoot across the sky

Oh, angels sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink, and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was hurt, withered, dried up
You came to rain a flood

So drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
We're on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
We're on a symphony
When I'm lower, lower, lower, low

Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
(Woo)
(Woo-ooo-ooo-woo)

Oh, angels sent from up above
I feel it coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out

Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
We're on a symphony
When I'm lower, lower, lower, low

Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
So high, so high
Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the (then we'll shoot)
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the


Been rusting in rubble
Running to a faint
Need a brand new coat of paint
I found myself in trouble
Thinking 'bout what ain't
Never gonna be a saint
Saying float like an eagle
Fall like the rain
Pouring to put out the pain
Oh again and again

Now I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I slip and I'm mesmerized

It's easy to be lethal
Learning from the news
It's a guidebook for the blues
Saying it's the very same steeple
People wanna chose
They just see it from different views
And threading the needle
Fixing my flame
Oh, oh now I'm moved to exclaim
Oh again, and again

How I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotized
Yeah I lift and I'm mesmerized

Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh oh-oh oohh

Oh again, and again
And I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I lift to a permanent high
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised
It was dark
Now it's sunrise


Darling, those tired eyes
Go with me all the time.
And in the dead of night
Tell me you will be mine.
Where do you go to, pretty baby?
Where do you go to, when the night wins away.
Ask me so sweetly, what do I do?
Who do I sing for?
Well honey I sing about you.

You.


One, two, three... well
I ran away from you
That's all I ever do
And though I started here
I ran away from you

I'm gonna come on in
And see it through

I ran away from you
That's all I ever do

And when I heard you call to
Come back to me
And though I should stay
I don't have the stomach to

Everyone I know
Says I'm a fool mess with you
Everyone I know
Says it's a stupid thing to do

I have your love on call
And yet my day is not so full
There might be nothing left to do
So I ran away from you

I'm gonna come on in
My eyes are closed

I can feel it there
The sun's so close
I'm gonna come on out
And burn the sky

A star arose in my own cage
I'm stuck in line
And in a cage

Just a single star
I sing for

Everyone I know
Says I'm a fool mess with you
Everyone I know
Says it's a stupid thing to do

I have your love on call
And yet my day is not so full
And I did not know what to do
And so I ran away from you


How long must I carry this band?
My solo career is already planned.
Hey mate
I don't mean to gloat
But it's time to get off of
The tails of my coat
My face
How could you resist
Wish the rest of this band
Didn't exist

Love me
I'm quirky and cute
I name my baby after a fruit

I am wise and I'm profound
They can stand in the background
I'm ready for my close up now
Make my torso fill the frame
Can you blur their faces some how?
Look the lights, are spelling my name

It's clear
I am the king
I rule this band
You may kiss my ring
Can't help
Being the star
Hey you on the drums
Go detail my car
And you polish my mic stand
I'm changing Coldplay
To the Chris Martin band

Oh no
This is the worst
The set is on fire
Rescue me first!
There'll be no band without me around
I'm the one they came to see
Although the set's burning to the ground
Don't take the camera off of me


So I was an idiot 
I was a goddamn idiot 
Because I came here so violent 
Because I came around here so violent 

I said yes, I was an idiot 
I was a goddamn idiot 
Because I made you think for it 
Because I came around here to think for it 

And sing it 
It's a wonderful life 
Never felt so alive 
Never felt so alive 
It's a wonderful life 
Never felt so alive 
Never felt so alive 

My love, my love, where have you been? 
My love, my love, where did you go? 
My love, my love, what have you seen? 
My love, you're such an idiot 

Like an idiot 
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off 
Like an idiot 
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off 
Like an idiot 
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off 
Like an idiot 

I was an idiot 
I fell down like a goddamn idiot 
Because I came here to bring them down 
Because I came around here to fight them down 
I said yes, I felt like an idiot 
I was a goddamn idiot 

Sing it 
It's a wonderful life 
Never felt so alive 
Never felt so alive 
It's a wonderful life 
Never felt so alive 
Never felt so alive 

My love, my love, where have you been? 
My love, my love, where did you go? 
My love, my love, what have you seen? 
My love, you're such an idiot 

Like an idiot 
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off 
Like an idiot 
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off 
Like an idiot 
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off 
Like an idiot 

Listen now, it's a wonderful life 
Never felt so alive 
It's a wonderful life 
Never felt so alive 
It's a wonderful life 

Never felt so alive 
Never felt so alive 
It's a wonderful life 
Never felt so alive 
Never felt so alive


In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah

I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh yeah

Yeah how long must you wait for it?
Yeah how long must you pay for it?
Yeah how long must you wait for it?
Oh for it

I was scared, I was scared
Tired and under prepared
But I wait for it

If you go, if you go
Leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you (yeah)

Yeah how long must you wait for it?
Yeah how long must you pay for it?
Yeah how long must you wait for it?
Oh for it

Sing it, please, please, please
Come back and sing to me, to me, me
Come on and sing it out, now, now
Come on and sing it out, to me, me
Come back and sing it

In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
And I was lost, oh yeah, oh yeah


Lovers keep on the road your on
Runners until the race is run
Soldiers you've got to soldier on
Sometimes even right is wrong

They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day, were gonna get out

Tonight, maybe we're gonna run
Dreamin' of the Osaka sun
Ohh, ohh, ohhh
Dreamin' of when the morning comes

They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day, the sun will come out

Reign of love
I can't let go
To the sea I offer
This heavy load

Locusts will
Lift me up
I'm just a prisoner
In a reign of love

Locusts will
Let us stop
I wish I'd spoken
To the reign of love

Reign of love
By the church, we?re waiting
Reign of love
My knees go praying

How I wish
I'd spoken up
Or we'd be carried
In the reign of love


Got a tattoo that said "2gether thru life"
Carved in your name with my pocket knife
And you wonder when you wake up, will it be alright oh oh
Feels like there's something broken inside

All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost 
Whenever you go
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much it hurts

Got a tattoo and the pain's alright (Oh oh oh oh)
Just want a way of keeping you inside (Oh oh oh oh oh)

All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
In your fire below
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much it hurts

I see the road begin to climb 
I see the stars begin to shine
I see your colors and I'm dying of thirst

All I know 
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

Oh yeah yeah yeah
So much it hurts
So much it hurts


This being human is a guest house
Every morning a new arrival

A joy, a depression, a meanness
Some momentary awareness comes
As an unexpected visitor

Welcome and entertain them all!
Be grateful for whoever comes
Because each has been sent as a guide


From the very start
It came apart
It broke up into pieces and
There was a chance and I missed it
It could risked it

And I put myself in your hands

Cause you're not just anyone
You're a ladder to the sun
Oh you're not just anyone
You're a ladder to the sun

I can run my courses
Opposing forces
And oh man I just...

Oh if you want me then you can have me
Oh take me, baby grab me
Oh if you want me then you can have me

Cause you're not just anyone
You're a ladder to the sun
Oh you're not just anyone
You're a ladder to the sun

Oh now boy what you mean I've done
You set a course that you couldn't run
Oh now boy what you mean I've done

I had it all and I risked it
I had it all and I risked it all
I risked it all

Oh I risked it all
A ladder to the
A Ladder to the sun
A ladder to the
A ladder to the sun
A ladder to the
A ladder to the sun
I had it all and I risked it all
A ladder to the
A ladder to the sun
A ladder to the
A ladder to the sun
A ladder to the
A ladder to the sun
I had it all and I risked it all
And I risked it
I had it all and I risked it all
I had it all and I risked it all


Kylie:

I'm all by myself
I don't need anybody else
I'm all by myself
No help

I'm all on my own
Quietly sleeping in my home
I'm all on my own
my own

Chris:

Hello
Won't you let me come in?
Lhuna, can't you hear how much I'm suffering?
Hello
Won't you let me know?
Cos I'm all alone
all alone

Both:

We are dreaming about Lhuna
The smell of her
The touch and the taste of her
dreaming about Lhuna
Her and me, simultaneously 

Kylie:

I don't know what the time is
I don't know where you've flown
And I don't know why you're so far
from home

Chris:

Hello
Won't you let me come in?
Lhuna, can't you hear how much I'm suffering?
Hello
Won't you let me know?
Cos I'm all alone
all alone

Both:

We are dreaming about Lhuna
The smell of her
The touch and the taste of her
dreaming about Lhuna
Her and me, simultaneously 
Her and me, effortlessly 
oh her and me effortlessly


There's a wild wind blowing,
Down the corner of my street
Every night there the headlights are glowing

there's a cold war coming,
On the radio I heard
Baby it's a violent world

Oh love don't let me go
Won't you take me where the streetlights glow
I could hear it coming
I could hear the sirens sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Time came a-creepin'
Oh and time's a loaded gun
Every road is a ray of light
It goes o-o-on
Time only can lead you on
Still it's such a beautiful night

Oh love don't let me go
Won't you take me where the streetlights glow
I could hear it coming
Like a serenade of sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Gravity release me,
And don't ever hold me down
Now my feet won't touch the ground.

Now I never meant
To do you wrong
That's what I came here to say

But if I was wrong
Then I'm sorry
I don't let it stand in our way

As my head just aches
When I think of
The things that I shouldn't have done

But, life is for living
We all know
And I don't want to live it alone

Sing
Ah, ah, oh
Sing
Ah, ah, oh,
And just think
Ah, ah, oh

'Cause in the end
There's only us
And oh my friend
There's only love

And in the cave
They're timing us
'Cause in the end
There's only love


I'm a rollin' stone all alone and lost
For a life of sin I have paid the cost
When I past by all the people say
Just another guy on the lost highway 

Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies makes a life like mine
On the day we met, oh I went astray
I started rolling down that lost highway

I was just a lad, nearly twenty two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord I paid a cost, on the lost highway

Now boy's don't start to ramblin' round
On this road of sin are you sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway
You started rollin' down that lost highway
You started rollin' down that lost highway
You started rollin' down that lost highway


Just because I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I'll stop
Doesn't mean I will cross

Just because I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserve
No better and no worse

I just got lost
Every river that I've tried to cross
And every door I ever tried was locked
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'till the shine wears off

You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause along may come
A bigger one
And you'll be lost

Every river that you tried to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'till the firing starts
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'till the shine wears off
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'till the shine wears off

You see the world in black and white
No color or life
You think you'll never get it right
But you're wrong, you might

The sky could fall, could fall on me
The parting of the seas
But you mean more, mean more to me
Than any color I can see

All you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or as up
As us

You see the world in black and white
Nothing too bright
You see no meaning to your life
Yes you try
Yes you try

And all you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
And all you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or as up

And don't you want to see it come soon
Floating in a big white balloon
Or given your own silver spoon

Don't you want to see it come down
Enough of throwing your arms around
And saying not a moment too soon

'Cause I feel low
'Cause I feel low
Ooh
Yeah I feel low
Oh no
Oh ooh
'Cause I feel low
'Cause I feel low
Ooh
And I feel low
Oh no
Ooh


[Instrumental]


Call it magic, call it true
I call it magic when I'm with you
And I just got broken, broken into two
Still I call it magic, when I'm next to you

And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

Ooh ooh ooh

Call it magic, cut me into two
And with all your magic, I disappear from view
And I can't get over, can't get over you
Still, I call it magic, such a precious truth

And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

Wanna fall, I fall so far
I wanna fall, fall so hard
And I call it magic
And I call it true
Call it magic

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

And if you were to ask me
After all that we've been through
Still believe in magic?
Well yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Of course I do


They got one eye watching you
One eye on what you do
So be careful who it is you're talking to
They got one eye watching you
One eye on what you do
So be careful what it is you're trying to do

And be careful when you're walking in the view
Just be careful when you're walking in the view

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on

They got one eye watching you
And one eye on what you do
So be careful 'cause nothing they say is true
D-don't believe a word, it's us against the world
And we just got to turn up to be heard

Hear the crocodiles ticking round the world
Hear those crocodiles ticking, they go ticking round the world

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and
You could hear them climbing the stairs
I got my right side fighting while
My left hides under the chairs

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you


In the darkness before the dawn
In the swirling of this storm
When I'm rolling with the punches and hope is gone
Leave a light, a light on

Millions of miles from home
In the swirling swimming on
When I'm rolling with the thunder but bleed from thorns
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

In the darkness before the dawn
In the darkness before the dawn
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on


From up above I heard
The angels sing to me these words
And sometimes in your eyes
I see the beauty in the world

Oh, now I'm floating so high
I blossom and die
Send your storm and your lightning to strike
Me between the eyes
Eyes

Sometimes the stars decide
To reflect in puddles in the dirt
When I look in your eyes
I forget all about what hurts

Oh, now I'm floating so high
I blossom and die
Send your storm and your lightning to strike
Me between the eyes
And cry

Believe in miracles

Oh hey, I'm floating up above the world now
Oh hey, I'm floating up above the world now

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, uh


[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
My father said never give up son
Just look how good Cassius become
Mohammed, Mahatma, and Nelson
Not scared to be strong

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
Now you could run and just say they're right
No I'll never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say no wait they're wrong
And get to keep on dancing all life long

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
My father said never give up son
Just look what Amelia and Joan done
Or Rosa, Teresa their war won
Not scared to be strong

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
Now you could run and just say they're right
No I'll never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say no wait, they're wrong
And get to keep on dancing all life long

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Yeah you could be someone special
You've got bright in your brains and lightning in your veins
You'll go higher than they've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got fire in your eyes and when you realize you'll go further than we've ever gone
Just turn it on

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Look I paid my intuition I couldn't afford tuition
My funds was insufficient, it felt like I'm in prison
Until I realized I had to set my mind free
I was trusting statistics more than I trust me
Get a degree, good job, 401k, but I'm trying to turn k's to m', what does it take?
And maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly
Instead of doing it just as a hobby like these boys told me to
I guess you either watch the show or you show and prove
Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself but honestly it's better if you do it for yourself
Never complacent till we hit the oasis
One life don't waste it feel my heart races, success I taste it, ah
Ah we on the verge of getting every single thing that we deserve

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Yeah you could be someone special
You've got fire in your eyes I see heaven inside you'll go further than we've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got bright in your brains you can break through those chains you'll go higher than we've ever gone
Just turn it on

[Outro: Chris Martin]
In you I see someone special
Don't go to war with yourself
Just turn, just turn, just turn it on and you can't go wrong


Come on now, don't you want to see?
This thing that's happening to me
Like Moses has power over sea
So you've got power over me 

Come on now, don't you want to know?
You're a refuge, somewhere I can go
You're air that, air that I can breathe
Cause you're my golden opportunity 

And oh, oh yes I would
If I only could
And you know I would
And baby I, oh baby I
I wish 

Come on now, don't you want to see?
Just what a difference you've made in me
I'll be waiting oh no matter what you say
Cause I've been waiting for days, days, days 

And oh, oh yes I would
If I only could
And you know I would
And baby I, oh baby I
I wish
I wish 

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
If the sky's gonna fall down, let it fall on me
If you're gonna break down, you can break on me
If the sky's gonna fall down, let it fall on me
If it's gonna rain down, it can rain on me
It can rain on me


Moving to mars
Somewhere up above the stars
The wreckage of a universe floats past
Somewhere up above my heart
A tiny little seed is sown,
A government is overthrown,
Who knows when we'll be coming home at last

And I heard it on the radio
That one day we'll be living in the stars
And I heard it on a tv show
That somewhere up above
And in my heart
They'll be tearing us apart,
Maybe moving us to mars
Past the satellites and stars,
Maybe moving us to mars

We won't see the earth again
In these seconds just remain unchanged
Eight to nine, nine to ten
We are meeting for the first time
We might never meet again you and me
We are meeting for the first time
Can't you see
Seven, six, five, four, three,
We are meeting for the first time

Singing this space symphony
They'll be tearing us apart moving us to mars,
Past the satellites and stars
They're moving us to mars


Tie me to a tree
Tie my hands above my head
Sing a song to me
Sing a song like what you said

Cause they're gonna murder me
They're gonna take me down
Something
I crumble down

Come spit at us
Come and throw your weight around
Come and fight with us
Come and rock me to the ground

Cause they're gonna murder me
They're gonna take me down
Something
I crumble down

So what can it possibly be?
Oh what can it possibly be?
Oh what can it possibly be?


[Instrumental]


Sometimes I wake up when I'm falling asleep
I think that maybe the curtains are closing on me
But I wake up, yes I wake up smiling

[Chorus]
So what I feel fine
I'm okay, I've seen the lighter side of life
I'm alright I feel good
So ill go, ill try to start moving

Sometimes I wake up and I'm falling asleep
But I've got to get going, so much that I wanted to do
But I wake up smiling

And this could be my last chance
Of saving my innocence
And this could be my last chance
No more keeping my feet on the ground

Sometimes I feel the chance is surprising
Surprisingly good to be moving around
And I move, and I wake up smiling

[Chorus]

And this could be my last chance
Of saving my innocence
And this could be my last chance
No more keeping my feet on the ground

And there's nothing to keep them
Nothing to keep them down
And there's nothing to keep them
There's nothing to keep them down.


Come up to meet ya, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need ya
And tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets, and nurse me your questions
Oh lets go back to the start
Running in circles, coming in tails
Heads on a science apart
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
And tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

Ooooohhhhhhh [x4]


Let me go boys, let me go
Push my bone from the highest cliff to the sea below
Rocks are waiting boys, rocks are waiting
Swoop down from the sky and catch me like the bird to prey

Now my feet won't touch the ground
Now my head won't stop
You wait a lifetime to be found
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Singing now my feet won't touch the ground
Now my head won't stop
You wait a lifetime to be found
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Now my feet won't touch the ground


A flock of birds
Hovering above
Just a flock of birds
That's how you think of love

And I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly always
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
They fly on

A flock of birds
Hovering above
Into smoke I'm turned
And rise following them up

Still I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive,
Next you know they're gone
They fly on
Fly on

So fly on
Ride through
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you

They fly on
Ride through
Maybe one day I come fly with you
Fly on
Fly on
Fly on


A flock of birds
Hovering above
Just a flock of birds
That's how you think of love

And I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly always
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
They fly on

A flock of birds
Hovering above
Into smoke I'm turned
And rise following them up

Still I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive,
Next you know they're gone
They fly on
Fly on

So fly on
Ride through
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you

They fly on
Ride through
Maybe one day I come fly with you
Fly on
Fly on
Fly on


Wait for your call, love
The call never came
Ready to fall, love
Ready to claim

I'm ready for it all, love
I'm ready for a pain
Meet under sun
Meet me again
In the rain
In the rain
In the rain
The rain

Behind the walls, love
I'm trying to change
And I'm ready for it all, love
I'm ready for a change
Meet under blue sky
Meet me again
In the rain
The rain, the rain
In the rain
The rain

Got to find yourself alone in this world
You've got to find yourself alone

Could you, could you come back
Come back together
Put yourself on the band
And see us forever 

Could you, could you come home
Come home forever
Surely things in the band
Keep us together 

Cause you're the one I love
You're the one I love
You're the one I love
Ahhhh, ahhhh

Could you, could you come home
Could you tell me whatever
Tie youself to a mast
It's now or it's never
Could it tear us apart
It'll soon be forever
It's gonna tear us apart 
Keep us together

You're the one I love
You're the one I love
Ahhh ahhh
You're the one I love
Yeah yeah you're the one

Oooooo...
Oooooo...

You're the one I love
You're the one I love
You're the one I love


The cardboard head I see
Has found its way to me
Its out and its out and its out
Making me cry
I sleep but I will not move
I'm too scared to leave my room
But I won't be defeated, oh no

[Chorus:]
What if cars don't go my way
And its sure to spoil my day?
But in voices loud and clear you say to me;
"Its only superstition
Its only your imagination
Its only all the things that you fear
And the things from which you can't escape"

Keep clean for the thousandth time
Stand still and wait in line
Some numbers are better than others
Oh no

[Chorus]

And its making me cry, and its making me cry
And I'm slipping away, I'm slipping away

Its only superstition, only your imagination
And its only superstition, only superstition.


In a haze
A stormy haze
I'll be round
I'll be loving you always
Always

Here I am and I'll take my time
Here I am and I'll wait in line always
Always


When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep and dreamed of
Para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach and the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly every tear a waterfall
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly

And dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh)

She'd dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
And so lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know the sun must set to rise"

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

This could be para-para-paradise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

This could be para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh, oh

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

This could be para-para-paradise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


Look at earth from outer space
Everyone must find a place
Give me time and give me space
Give me real don't give me fake
Give me strength reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Give me time give us a kiss
Tell me your own politik

And open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes

Give me one, 'cause one is best
In confusion, confidence
Give me peace of mind and trust
Don't forget the rest of us
Give me strength reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Wounds that heal and cracks that fix
Tell me all your politik

And open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Just open up your eyes

But give me love over, love over, love over this, ah
And give me love over, love over, love over this, ah


Smoke is rising from the houses
People Burying their dead
I ask somebody what the time is
But time doesn't matter to them yet

People talking without speaking
Trying to take what they can get
I ask you if you remember
Propekt, how could I forget?

Drums
Here it comes
Don't you wish that life could be as simple,
As fish swimming round in a barrel.
When you've got the gun?

Oh and I'll run
Here it comes
We're just two little figures in a soup bowl
Trying to get the anaconda control
When I wasn't one

Here I lie
On my own in a separate sky
Here I lie
On my own in a separate sky
I don't want to die
On my own, here, tonight
Here I lie
On my own in a separate sky


[Instrumental]


Pour me, floatin' out to see
An opportunity that went by
Pour you, now what you gonna do?
Now what you gonna do? You just cry

Pour me, so blind I couldn't see
The flowers for the trees, I don't know why
Pour you, you split yourself in two
Now what you gonna do? You just cry

I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand
I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand

Pour me, floatin' out to see
An opportunity that went by
Pour you, now what you gonna do?
What you gonna do? You just cry

I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand
I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand

I don't understand
I don't understand

For feel ?
Strong at alley, I'm gonna feel it now
I'm gonna feel it now, sing, say, say


Once upon a time somebody ran
Somebody ran away saying, "Fast as they can"
I got to go
I got to go

Once upon a time we fell apart
You're holding in your hands
The two halves of my heart
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Once upon a time we're burning bright
That all we ever seemed to do is fight
On and on
And on and on and on

Once upon a time on the same side
Once upon a time on the same side
In the same game, now why'd you have to go
Have to go and throw it all in my flame

Could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could have had a castle and worn a ring
But no, you let me go

I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could have had a castle and worn a ring,
But no, you let me go

Stole my star
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
You stole my star
La-la-la-la-la-la

'Cause you really hurt me
Oh you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
Oh you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
Oh-oh, you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
You really hurt me


So I waited for you
What wouldn't I do?
And I'm covered it's true
I'm covered in you

If I ever want proof
I find it in you
Yeah I honestly do
In you I find proof

Light, dark
Bright spark
Light, dark, and then light

So I waited all day
What wouldn't I say
And all the thing in you way
Things happen that way

And if I ever want proof
Then I find it in you
Yeah I honestly do
In you I find proof

Light, dark
Bright spark
Light, dark, and then light

Light, light, light... light...

Then there was rain
The sky wore a veil of gold and gray
At night it was the bright of the moon with me
Time was just floating

Then there was rain
This town's foundations are crumbling
To the ground comes a bit of a tumbling
And time just floated away
We can watch it and stay and we can listen

Oh, rainy day, come round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're separated now
I'm down
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

Then there was rain
And I spent the night with the Queen of Spain
My lonely little heart would've broke again
Times were vicious

Singing, deeper that the knife goes in the more you win
You win but with less than when you begin
Deeper that the knife goes in
Oooooooooooooooh

Ooh, rainy day come round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
We're separated now
I'm down
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

Aaaaah aaaah aaaaaah
Aaaaah aaaah aaaaaah
Aaaaah aaaah aaaaaah

But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house


They tried to make me go to rehab
I said, "No, no, no"
Yes, I been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab 
I won't go, go, go

I'd rather be at home with a Ray
I ain't got seventy days
Because there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway

I didn't get a lot in class
But I know we don't come in a shot glass

They tried to make me go to rehab
I said, "No, no, no"
Yes, I been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab 
I won't go, go, go

The man said, "Why do you think you here?"
I said, "I got no idea"
I'm going to, I'm going to lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near
He said, "I just think you're depressed"
This, me, yeah, baby, and the rest

They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said, "No, no, no"
Yes, I been black 
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know

I don't ever want to drink again
I just, oh, I just need a friend
I'm not going to spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend

And it's not just my pride
It's just until these tears have dried

They tried to make me go to rehab
I said, "No, no, no"
Yes, I been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab 
I won't go, go, go


Lovers, keep on the road you're on
Runners, until the race is run
Soldiers, you've got to soldier on
Sometimes even the right is wrong

They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day, we're gonna get out

Tonight maybe we're gonna run
Dreaming of the Osaka sun
Oh, oh,
Dreaming of when the morning comes

They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day the sun will come out

Oh,

Reign of love
I can't let it go
To the sea I offer
This heavy load

Locusts will
Lift me up
I'm just a prisoner
In a reign of love

Locusts will
Let us stop
I wish I'd spoken
To the reign of love

Reign of love
By the church, we're waiting
Reign of love
My knees go praying

How I wish
I'd spoken up
Or we'd be carried
On the reign of love


Oh, Love is a burning thing
And it makes a firey ring 
Found my wild desire
I sleep into a ring of fire

I fell into a burnin ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

Oh, I fell into a burnin ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went hgher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

Oh, The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet 
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire was wild

Oh, I feel into a burnin ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire 
The ring of fire 

I fell into a burnin ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire 
The ring of fire 

And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire...


See you lost your trust and you never should have, you never should have.
Don't break your back if you ever see this.
Don't answer that.
In a bullet proof vest with the windows all closed
I'll be doing my best
I'll see you soon.
In a telescope lens when all you want is friends
I'll see you soon.

And you know how much I need you
But you never even see me


Climb up your mountain, nineteen and countin'
You have got seven, I have got one
Blinded and hurtin', this I'm deserving
I've got my secrets, you've only got the sleeping sun

When you've got a secret then you've got to keep it
When you have a question, answers will come
Running and hiding, take and dividing
You've got your secrets, I've only got a sleeping sun

Sleeping sun
Singing
Ooh, ooh, ohh, ohh
Ahh, ohh, ahh, ohh

And you, as I saw, a piece in a jigsaw
Run up and around it and jump up real tall
Run round the houses north and the south is
You've got your answers, we've only got a sleeping sun

Sleeping sun
Singing
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Ahh, ohh, ahh, ohh



Oh, when I get back on solid ground
I'm gonna crawl my way to you
Oh, I once was lost and now I'm found
I'm gonna do what I should do

And when I get back on my feet again
I'm gonna run my way to you
Oh, when all is lost and come undone
I'm gonna say I see it through.

But oh, the water, the water flows over

Oh, when I get back off my feet again
I'm gonna crown my days a turn
So all I've been on my knees again
And I'll do it all the time

And when I get back on solid ground
I'm gonna crawl my way to you
Oh, I once was lost, but now I'm found
So here's what I'm gonna do

I sing oh, the water, the water flows over
I sing oh, the water, the water flows over you


We were just about to lose our home
Diamonds ate the radio
Moving in the dead of night
We took photographs just some just so
History someone to know
We were moving at the speed of flight

Kids cry
If you want to
That's alright
If you want to
Hold me
Hold me tight

Just an alien

We were hovering without a home
Millions are UFO
Hovering in hope some scope tonight
Sees the light and says

Fly if you want to
That's alright
But if you want to
Call me
Call this line

Just an alien
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again

Tell your leader
Sir or ma'am
We come in peace
We mean no harm
Somewhere out there
In the unknown
All the E.T.'s are phoning home
Watching my life
On the skyline
Crossing your eyes
All a lifetime

Just an alien (moving target)
Target movement
Oh, we just want to get home again
Of the space time
Turning forward
Turning pages
Over Asia
Crossing ages
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again


Talking to the songbird yesterday 
Flew me to a place not far away 
She's a little pilot in my mind 
Singing songs of love to pass the time
Gonna write a song so she can see 
Give her all the love she gives to me 
Talk of better days that have yet to come 
I never felt this love from anyone
She's not anyone 
She's not anyone 
She's not anyone
A man can never dream these kind of things 
Especially when she came and spread her wings 
Whispered in my ear the things I'd like 
Then she flew away into the night
Gonna write a song so she can see 
Give her all the love she gives to me 
Talk of better days that have yet to come 
Never felt this love from anyone
She's not anyone 
She's not anyone 
She's not anyone



So we left La Mancha
Headed out for higher plains
Me and Sancho Panza
Looking for adventure
Rocinante at the reins
To the windmills answer
You'll never be lonely
You'll never be lonely ever again
You'll never be lonely
You'll never be lonely ever again

Chorus:
I heard you never get wet in spanish rain

So they sent the doctor
For examining my brain
Said it's not too clever
Oh, when the world, when the world just seems a little bit too cruel
Gonna leave it better
Make one better
So tell that princess
Tell that princess right down the train
Tell that princess she'll never be lonely again

Chorus:
I heard you never get wet in spanish rain x2

Ol',Ol',Ol',Ol',Ol' x7

Chorus:
I heard you never get wet in spanish rain


Did I drive you away
I know what you'll say
You say, oh, sing one we know
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
That's what I'll do

I say oh
I say oh

My heart is yours
It's you that I hold on to
That's what I do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
(Oh yeah, yeah, yes I will)

I say oh
I cry oh

And I saw sparks
Yeah I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah I saw sparks
Sing it out

La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh


How long before I get in?
Before it starts, before I begin?
How long before you decide?
Before I know what it feels like?
Where To, where do I go?
If you never try, then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb,
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?

Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get
Is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop
Before I see things the right way up

All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I have found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand?

Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Japan and China all lit up
The sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me

All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I have found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Ah when you see it then you'll understand?

All those signs, I knew what they meant
Some things you can invent
Some get made, and some get sent
Oh
Birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Ah, when you see it then you'll understand?


I awake to find no peace of mind
I said how do you live as a fugitive
Down here where I cannot see so clear
I said, what do I know
Show me the right way to go

And the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
But the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them no, 'cause they're all spies
They're all spies

I awake to see that no one is free
We're all fugitives
Look at the way we live
Down here, I cannot sleep from fear no
I said, which way do I turn
Oh I forget everything I learn

And the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
The spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them no
'Cause they're all spies
They're all spies

And if we all hide here
They're going to find us
And if we don't hide now
They're going to catch us where we sleep
And if we don't hide here
They're going to find us

And spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so good 'cause you know
Though spies hide out in every corner
They can't touch you no
'Cause they're just spies
They're just spies
They're just spies
They're just spies
They're just spies


You're in control
Is there anywhere you want to go?
You're in control
Is there anything you want to know?
The future's for discovering
The space in which we're traveling

From the top of the first page
To the end of the last day
From the start in your own way
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are

Under the surface trying to break through
Deciphering the codes in you
I need a compass, draw me a map
I'm on the top, I can't get back

Whoa whoa

The first line on the first page
To the end of the last page
From the start in your own way
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter who you are

You just want
Somebody listening to what you say
Oh, you just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter who you are

Is there anybody out there who
Is lost and hurt and lonely too
Are they bleeding all your colors into one?
And if you come undone
As if you've been run through
Some catapult it fired you
You wonder if your chance will ever come
Or if you're stuck in square one


They were sitting
They were talking in the strawberry swing
Every moment was so precious

They were sitting
They were talking in the strawberry swing
Everybody was for fighting
Wouldn't wanna waste a thing

Cold, cold water
Bring me round
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Cold, cold water
What ya say?
It's such
It's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

I remember
We were walking up to strawberry swing
I can't wait 'til the morning
Wouldn't wanna change a thing

People moving all the time
Inside a perfectly straight line
Don't you wanna curve away
It's such
It's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

Now the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
Could be blue

I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
Could be blue,
Could be grey
Without you I'm just miles away

Could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time.


Well I sold the farm to take my woman
Where she used to be
We left our kin and all our friends
Back there in Tennessee
And I bought those one way tickets
She had often begged me for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore
Well her heart was filled with gladness
When she saw those city lights
She said the prettiest place on earth was
Baltimore at night
Well a man feels proud to give his woman
What she's longing for
And I kinda liked the streets of Baltimore
Then I got myself a factory job
I ran an old machine
And I bought a little cottage
In a neighborhood serene
And every night when I'd come home
With every muscle sore
She'd drag me through the streets of Baltimore
Well I did my best to bring her back
To what she used to be
Then I soon learned she loved those bright lights
More than she loved me
Now I'm a going back on that same train
That brought me here before
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore


Such a rush to do nothing at all
Such a fuss to do nothing at all
Such a rush to do nothing at all
Such a rush to get nowhere at all
Such a fuss to do nothing at all
Such a rush.
And it's just like you said,
It's just like you said.
Such a rush to do nothing at all.
Such a fuss to get nowhere at all.
Such a rush X2
And it's just like you said.
It's just like you said.
So slow down please,
Just slow down,
So slow down please,
Just slow down.
Such a rush x15
Look at all the people going after money.
Far to many people looking for their money.
Everybody's out there, trying to get money.
Why can't you just tell me,
Try to get money, rush.
Such a rush.
They all rush.
Such a rush x7


You cut me down a tree
And brought it back to me
And that's what made me see
Where I was going wrong
You put me on a shelf
And kept me for yourself
I can only blame myself
You can only blame me

And I could write a song
A hundred miles long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me

And I could write it down
Or spread it all around
Get lost and then get found
Or swallowed in the sea

You put me on a line
And hung me out to dry
And darling that's when I
Decided to go to sea

You cut me down to size
And opened up my eyes
Made me realize
What I could not see

And I could write a book
The one they'll say that shook
The world, and then it took
It took it back from me

And I could write it down
Or spread it all around
Get lost and then get found
And you'll come back to me
Not swallowed in the sea

Ooh, ooh

And I could write a song
A hundred miles long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me

The streets you're walking on
A thousand houses long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me

Oh what good is it to live
With nothing left to give
Forget but not forgive
Not loving all you see

Oh the streets you're walking on
A thousand houses long
Well that's where I belong
And you belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea

You belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea
Yeah, you belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea

Oh brother, I can't, I can't get through
I've been trying hard to reach you 'cause I don' know what to do
Oh brother, I can't believe it's true
I'm so scared about the future, and I wanna talk to you
Oh, I wanna talk to you

You can take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be?
You can climb a ladder up to the sun
Or a write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that's never been done

Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?
Tell me, how do you feel?
Well, I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak
And they're talking it to me

So you take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be?
You can climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that's never been done
Or do something that's never been done

So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk
And you feel like you're going where you've been before
You tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored
Nothing's really making any sense at all, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk, let's talk


Oh brother, I can't, I can't get through
I've been trying hard to reach you 'cause I don' know what to do

You tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored
Nothing's really making any sense at all, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk, let's talk


And in the end
We lie awake
And we dream
We'll make an escape

And in the end
We lie awake
And we dream
We'll make an escape

Ooh?


Sleep on the ocean
Sleep on the sand
Ive been very busy since the fall of man
Son of the devil
You wont understand
Now come on, baby,
That's a sudden end

Speak of the devil
Inside my head
You've been very busy since the world's gonna end
Tired of the symbol
The sun, the sand
Talk a little louder, I don't understand.

Gonna get the supper to the world tonight
??? I'm gonna fall asleep.
Theres a tiny little sin I've gotta do.
Got to say that I'm only holding up at night
Turn with the flow, or this storm

Theres a world outside, wanna let you in
Theres a world outside, not going in
The world outside, won't let you in

Love, love got over that storm
Before you get somewhere,
Oh, love got over that storm.

I've got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack.
I went out for a ride, and I never came back. 


I went digging for gold
I went down to the valley
Over by the mountain
Where the Prospektor had been told
I'm marching through the cold
We're marching through the cold

I went digging for gold
I went down with my brother
A bucket and a shovel
And a book about the colour of coal
I'm marching through the cold
We're marching through the cold

There's a tiny little crackle on the telephone line
Saying what use the metal if the metal don't shine?
She said bring me back a ring 'cause I really want one
Now I been digging so long that I never see the sun

I went digging for gold
I went down to the valley
Over by the mountain
Where the Prospektor had been told
I'm marching through the cold
We're marching through the cold

There's a tiny little crackle on the telephone line
Saying what use is the metal if the metal don't shine?
She said bring me back a ring 'cause I really want one
Now I been digging so long that I never see the sun
Now I been digging so long that I never see the sun
Now I been digging so long that I never see the sun


And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
Was the hardest part

And the strangest thing
Was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start

I could feel it go down
Bittersweet I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the cloud
Oh and I
I wish that I could work it out

And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
You really broke my heart

And I tried to sing
But I couldn't think of anything
And that was the hardest part

I could feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
You're silver lining the clouds
Oh and I
Oh and I
I wonder what it's all about
I wonder what it's all about

Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it's just comes undone
And everything is torn apart

Oh and it's the part
That's the hardest part
Yeah that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part


Come up to meet you
Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start
Running in circles; coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start

I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science; science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
(Ah oh oh)


X and why
The land, sea, rivers, trees
The stars, the sky
That and this
We're part of a bigger plan
Don't know what it is
Don't know what it is

You and me
The land, sun, trees, the sky
The stars, the sea
Three hundred and sixty five degrees
I am the puzzle, you're the missing piece
Hang on a minute, just a minute, please
I'll come
And everything under the sun
And everything under the sun

What is this feeling that I can't explain?
And why am I never gonna sleep again?
What is this thing I've never seen before?
A little boy lost in a breaking storm

Pilots up, and away they fly
Some write your name in the summer sky
Life has really only just begun
Life, it comes
And everything under the sun

X is why
The land, sea, rivers, trees
The stars, the sky
Three hundred and sixty five degrees
All of the surface and the underneath
Searching the measures in this extra key, ah
And everything under the sun
And everything under the sun

What is this feeling that I can't explain?
And why am I never gonna sleep again?
What is this thing I've never seen before?
A little boy lost in a breaking storm

Pilots up, and away they fly
Some write your name in the summer sky
Life has really only just begun
Life, it comes
And everything under the sun

And you don't know that you've been born
Can't see the calm until the storm
Can't tell your right side from your wrong
Can't see the wave you're riding on...


How tides control the sea, and what becomes of me
How little things can slip out of your hands
How often people change, no two remain the same
Why things don't always turn out as you plan

These are things that I don't understand
Yeah, these are things that I don't understand

I can't, and I can't decide
Wrong, all my wrong from right
Day, all my day for night
Dark, all my dark for light
I live, but I love this life

How infinite is space, and who decides your fate
Why everything will dissolve into sand
How to avoid defeat, when truth and fiction meet
Why nothing even turns out how you planned

These are things that I don't understand
Yeah, these are things that I don't understand

I can't, and I can't decide
Wrong, all my wrong from right
Day, all my day for night
Or dark, all my dark for light
I live, but I love this life


Steal my heart and hold my tongue
I feel my time, my time has come
Let me in, unlock the door
I've never felt this way before

And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummer begins to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know which way I've come

Hold my head inside your hands
I need someone who understands
I need someone, someone who hears
For you, I've waited all these years

For you I'd wait 'til kingdom come
Until my day, my day is done
And say you'll come and set me free
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me

In your tears and in your blood
In your fire and in your flood
I hear you laugh, I heard you sing
I wouldn't change a single thing

And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummers begin to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know what I'll become

For you I'd wait 'til kingdom come
Until my days, my days are done
And say you'll come and set me free
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me

Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me


Oh no I see
A spider web it's tangled up with me
And I lost my head
And thought of all the stupid things I said
Oh no what's this
A spider web and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
The thought of all the stupid things I've done

And I never meant to cause you trouble
And and I never meant to do you wrong
And ah well if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no I never meant to do you harm

Oh no I see
A spider web and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
Here am I in my little bubble

Singing out
I never meant to cause you trouble
And I never meant to do you wrong
And ah well if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no I never meant to do you harm

They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me


For a second, I was in control
I had it once, I lost it though
And all along the fire below would rise

And I wish you could have let me know
What's really going on below
I've lost you now, you let met go but one last time

Tell me you love me, if you don't then lie, oh lie to me

Remember once upon a time, when I was yours and you were blind
The fire would sparkle in your eyes and mine

So tell me you love me, if you don't then lie, oh lie to me
Just tell me you love, if you don't then lie, oh lie to me
If you don't then lie, oh lie to me
And call it true, call it true love
Call it true, call it true love


Sunlight, opened up my eyes
To see for the first time
It opened them up
And tonight, rivers will run dry
But not for the first time
Rivers will run

Hundreds of years in the future
There could be computers
Looking for life on Earth
Don't fight for the wrong side
Say what you feel like
Say how you feel

You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards, again
You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go

Created, then drilled and invaded
If somebody made it
Someone will mess it up
And you are not wrong to
Ask who does this belong to?
It belongs to all of us

You'll go backwards, again
You'll go forwards, again
You'll go backwards, again
You'll go forwards

You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards, again
You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards


Lord I don't know which way I am going
Which way, the river gonna flow
It's just seems that upstream, I keep rolling
Still got such a long way to go
Still got such a long way to go

Then at last, it's your right, I know, I swear
We'll find somewhere the streets are paved with gold
But it's fly, split the sky
But that's all right, sometimes
The sunlight comes streaming through the holes


There is a place, it has a face and he was walking out the door.
His mother said she was ashamed, because he had no place to go.
He was afraid, and I was fine, he wanted peace of mind.

Three times done, and your gone, and your gone, you are free, you are free. Its a long way home, what have we done, was it wrong? was it wrong? was it me? can't you see its a long way home.

There is a snake, he will awake, and he will get you off the floor.
You'll start to shake your friends will sweat, you are high you will forget. She is afraid, cuz you are dying. But you have got your peace of mind.

Three times done, and your gone, and your gone, you are free, you are free. Its a long way home, what have we done, was it wrong? was it wrong? was it me? can't you see its a long way home.

And i wont make your dreams come true, its all you. You've got to change your lonely ways to make it through.

You found a place in outterspace and you don't hurt anymore.
Your lovely hand has slipped away, and there is nothing left to say.
And we are born of yellow sand, there is no plan there is no end.

Three times done and your gone, and your gone, you are free, you are free,
its a long way home. All night long, i was wrong i was wrong, it was me, can't you see its a long way home.

It took a million miles to see that smile, oh don't touch its to much,
to break it and send you home, a fraid of love afraid you might get hurt, oh good luck, don't get stuck, turn around before you can't go back.


So it's over,
This time I know it's gone
Salt water tasted it too long
I only know I'm wrong
Now I know it's gone

Up in flames, up in flames
Up in flames we have slowly gone

So it's over,
This time you're flying on
This time I know no song
Can stop it slowly burn
Can stop it slowly gone

Up in flames, up in flames
Up in flames we have slowly gone

Up in flames, up in flames
Up in flames we have slowly gone
Oh, we have slowly gone
Can we pour some water on?


The birds they sang, at break of day
Start again I hear them say
It's so hard to just walk away

The birds they sang, all a choir
Start again a little higher
It's a spark in a sea of gray

The sky is blue dream that lie 'till it's true
Then taken back the punch I threw
My arms turn in oh, those clumsy things
Send me up to that wonderful world
And then I'm up with the birds

Might have to go
Where they don't know my name
Float all over the world
Just to see her again
And I won't show or feel any pain
Even though all my armor might rust in the rain

A simple plot
But I know one day
Good things are coming our way

A simple plot
But I know one day
Good things are coming our way

Oh, yeah


Oh morning come bursting, the clouds amen
Lift off this blindfold, let me see again
Bring back the water, let your ships roll in
In my heart she left a hole

The tightrope that I'm walking just sways and ties
The devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes
And I just want to be there when the lightning strikes
And the saints go marching in

And sing slow it down
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world

Like a river to a raindrop, I lost a friend
My drunken as a Daniel in a lion's den
And tonight I know it all has to begin again
So whatever you do, don't let go

And if we could float away
Fly up to the surface and just start again
And lift off before trouble
Just erodes us in the rain

Just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us and see roses
In the rain

Sing slow it down
Slow it down

Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world


Was a long and dark December
From the rooftops I remember
There was snow
White snow

Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below

When the future's architecture
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

If you love me
Won't you let me know?

Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And the fog
Became God

Priests clutched onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And the cross was held aloft

Bury me in armor
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

If you love me
Won't you let me know?

I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow 
Far below

So if you love me
Why'd you let me go?

I took my love down to violet hill
There we sat in snow
All the time she was silent and still

So if you love me
Won't you let me know?

If you love me
Won't you let me know?


I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world


A warning sign
I missed the good part, then I realized
I started looking and the bubble burst
I started looking for excuses
Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so

A warning sign
It came back to haunt me, and I realized
That you were an island and I passed you by
When you were an island to discover
Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so
And I'm tired
I should not have let you go

(Oh oh oh)

So I crawl back into your open arms
Yes I crawl back into your open arms
And I crawl back into your open arms
Yes I crawl back into your open arms


I want to live life
Never be cruel
I want to live life
Be good to you

I want to fly
And never come down
And live my life
And have friends around

We never change do we, no, no
We never learn do we

So I want to live in a wooden house
I want to live life always be true
I want to live life and be good to you

I want to fly and never come down
And live my life
And have friends around

We never change do we
No no
We never learn do we

So I want to live in a wooden house
Where making more friends would be easy

Oh and I don't have a soul to save
Yes and I sin every single day

We never change do we
We never learn do we

So I want to live in a wooden house
Where making more friends would be easy
I want to live where the sun comes out


I'll keep it in my head till I know I
Until I know that I can leave your doorstep
Until I know the conversations cold
I'll hide it in the words until I know I
Until I know that I can be alone here
Until I know the consequences known

We're all in love with something that we can't see
We're all in love with something that we can't see
I'm in love with something that we can't see
I'm in love with someone that we can't see

I'll throw you out and bring you back later
Everything I see's a complication
Everyone I known has come and go
I've fallen in the reason for the passion
Everyone needs something for their hands when
When they know they're gonna be alone

We're all in love with something that we can't see
We're all in love with something that we can't see
I'm in love with something that we can't see
I'm in love with someone that we can't see

I'm looking for something to shout
Something I know I cannot doubt
I'm looking for something to shout
Something I know I cannot doubt
Come on won't help me out

We're all in love with something that we can't see
We're all in love with something that we can't see
I'm in love with something that we can't see
I'm in love with someone that we can't see

I'm in love without you
I'm in love without you 
I'm in love without you 
I'm in love without you

We're all in love with something that we can't see
We're all in love with something that we can't see
I'm in love with something that we can't see
I'm in love with someone that we can't see


Those wedding bells were ringing up upon that hill
And I don't wanna swallow such a bitter pill
You keep on moving, but I stay still
But I always loved you, and I always will

Days of no sleeping, caked in mud
All kinds of poison in my blood
I lost the only thing I ever loved

I heard them ringing and procession by
Umbrellas in that clear blue sky
And saw you swimming in that sea of white

Wedding Bells ringing up upon that hill
And I don't wanna swallow such a bitter pill
You keep on moving, baby I stay still
I always loved you and I always will

I loved you and I say it still
I always loved you and I always will

If everything that went before didn't matter
I always loved you and I always will


What if there was no lie
Nothing wrong, nothing right
What if there was no time
And no reason, or rhyme
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in your life

What if I got it wrong
And no poem or song
Could put right what I got wrong
Or make you feel I belong

What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in you life

Oooooooh that's right
Let's take a breath try to put it aside
Ooooooh that's right
How can you know it if you don't even try
Ooooooh that's right

Every step that you take
Could be your biggest mistake
It could bend or it could break
That's the risk that you take

What if you should decide
That you don't want me there in your life
That you don't want me there by your side

Oooooooh that's right
Let's take a breath try to put it aside
Ooooooh that's right
How can you know when you don't even try
Ooooooh that's right


What the world needs now
Is love, sweet love
That's the only things that there's just too little of

What the world needs now
Is love, sweet love
That's the only things that there's just too little of


Bono : 
Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying 

Chris :
Oh, Brother, brother, brother 
There's far too many of you dying 
You know you've got to find a way 
To bring some lovin' here to stay 

Bono :
Father, father 
We don't need to escalate 
And war is not the answer 
For only love can conquer hate 

Chris :
You know we've got to find a way 
To bring some lovin' here to stay 
Picket lines won't block our way 

Bono :
Don't punish me with brutality 
Talk to me, and you can see 
What's going on 
What's going on 
What's going on 
What's going on 

Father, father, everybody thinks we're wrong 
But who are they to judge us 
Together we can be strong 

Chris:
You know we've got to find a way 
To bring some lovin' here to stay 
Picket lines won't block our way 
Don't punish me with brutality 
Talk to me, so you can see 
What's going on, what's going on 
What's going on, what's going on 
What's going on, what's going on 
What's going on, what's going on


Where is my boy?
I saw you come out of a scene
Maybe in some kind of dream
Something that never comes

Time that I take...
See over in arms I'll raise
I'll race in to find you
I'll race in to find you

Time stands
I open your eyes to my world
I see you come out of it all
Unharmed and unscathed
And shouting, oh

Come on in
In houses I live in
And changes you're making
To the state of affairs

Calling 'where is my boy?'
I have seen you so often
I cry 'where is my boy?'
Oh, have you all forgotten?

And in some kind of dream
Have I seen you before
Oh, have I seen you before?
Oh, where is my boy?

So come all the way
Changing your number
Changing the house where you live
Change your lines

Have I seen you before?
In some kind of a dream?
In a place you've forgotten
A place I've forgotten

So where is my boy?
When I kneel in your arms
I flew awry
Where is my boy?

Have I seen you before?
In some kind of a dream?
Have I seen you before?
In some kind of a dream?

In my hands you'll fall
Open in as it seems
Have I seen you before?

Oh baby, your arms and your legs are shattered
Where is my boy?
Where is my boy?

I said 'where is my boy?'
Have you seen me before?
When I look in your eyes
Tell me 'he had to go'

Said 'I seen you before
In some kind of dream'
Seems I've seen you before
In some kind of a dream

I say 'where is the boy?'
Have I seen you before?
Yeah, I saw you before
In some kind of a dream

I say 'where was my head?
When I needed it most?'
Oh, I stayed here before
Yes I stay in the place I know.


When I was a young boy I tried to listen
And I want to feel like that
Little white shadows blink and I missed em
Part of a system, a plan

If you ever feel like something's missing
Things you'll never understand
Little white shadows sparkle and glisten
Part of a system plan

All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
All this sound is breaking up

Whoa oh

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state

Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

When I was a young boy I tried to listen
Don't you want to feel like that

You're part of the human race
All of the stars and the outer space
Part of the system plan

All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
I cannot hear, you're breaking up

Whoa oh

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state

Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it, you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

Swimming on a sea of faces
A tide of the human race
So, an answer now is what I need

I see it in the new sun rising
I see it break on your horizon
Oh come on love, stay with me


(So I race for it)
Stare into darkness, staring at doom
My heart boom, bo-boom boom
Stare into darkness, admit defeat
Coming home and I'm finding no peace

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm out of luck
And I know, and I know and I know
I know what you've got

So I put my hands up to the sky, feel alive
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
I put my hands up to the sky, it's all right
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

(So I race for it) wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I race for it)

Stare into darkness, staring at doom
You make my heart go boom, bo-boom boom
Superhero, a masterpiece
Been in a city but it centered around me

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm in luck
And I know, and I know and I know
I know when I'm not

I just put my hands up to the sky, feel alive
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
I put my hands up to the sky, feel it inside
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

I just put my hands up to the sky, feeling alright
I've got a rocket, eyes on the prize

Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

(So I reach for it) wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I reach for it)yeah yeah wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I reach for it) and I know, and I know, and I know 
(So I reach for it) I know what I've got
X marks the spot
So I put my hands up to the sky,  feeling alright

Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

I put my hands up to the sky, feeling alright
I've got a rocket, eyes on the price
I put my hands up to the sky, I'm gonna fly
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure, yeah yeah wherever you are


Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called yellow

So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
You know you know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh what a thing to do

'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
And you know
For you I'd bleed myself dry
For you I'd bleed myself dry

It's true
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do


When it started we had high hopes
Now my back's on the line
My back's on the ropes
When it started we were alright
But night makes a fool of us in daylight

Yeah we were dying of frustration
Saying "Lord lead me not into temptation"
But it's not easy when she turns you on
Since they gone

If you'll only, if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God only, God knows I'm trying my best
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness

So, up they picked me by the big toe
I was held from the rooftop, then they let go
There's only screaming
Let the windows, down
As I crawl to the ground

If you'll only, if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God, only God knows she won't let me rest
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness
I've become so tired of this loneliness.


Her name is Yoshimi 
She's a black belt in karate
Working for the city 
She has to discipline her body 

Because she knows that it's demanding 
To defeat those evil machines 
I know she can beat them 

Oh Yoshimi, they don't believe me 
But you won't let those robots eat me 
Yoshimi, they don't believe me 
But you won't let those robots defeat me 

Those evil-natured robots 
They're programmed to destroy us 
She's got to be strong to fight them 
So she's taking lots of vitamins 

Because she knows that it'd be tragic 
If those evil robots win 
I know she can beat them 

Oh Yoshimi, they don't believe me
But you won't let those robots defeat me
Yoshimi, they don't believe me
But you won't let those robots eat me
Yoshimi 

Because she knows that it'd be tragic
If those evil robots win
I know she can beat them

Oh Yoshimi, they don't believe me
But you won't let those robots defeat me
Yoshimi, they don't believe me
But you won't let those robots eat me
Yoshimi, they don't believe me
But you won't let those robots defeat me
Yoshimi, they don't believe me
But you won't let those robots eat 
Yoshimi


You only live twice
Oh, so it seems
One life for yourself
And one for your dreams

You drift through the years
And life seems stray
Till one dream appears
And love is its way

I'd love you to strangers
Ooh, beckon you on
Don't think of the danger
For a stranger is gone

This dream is for you
So pay the price
Make one dream come true
You only live twice

This dream is for you
So pay the price
Make one dream come true
You only live twice
You only live twice


I slipped away last night 
Took me away from sight and the place I know. 
All crushed upon my skin 
This mess I put you in and the punch I threw. 
It was a strange reaction 
for someone like you to remain on side 
And in a chain reaction 
I was down and calling for a place to hide. 
I saw a broken arm 
Machines will all break down in the way I know. 
Mended and all made clean 
I saw up on the screen all the stones I throw. 
It was a strange reaction 
for someone like you to remain so sure 
And in a chain reaction 
I dissolve and break and then away I crawl.



I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
Or scared of having nothing left

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to?

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?


Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

That's made you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me

Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say

I make you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me

But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I will do until I'm finding myself you

And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you


When did it go wrong, I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down, I go round and round
Thinking about it all the time

I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love, it ain't all greed
There's too much that I haven't said

Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know I can't let go

Why were you so cold, let the truth me told
Tell me was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking, I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill

I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me

Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know I can't let go

Oooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Oooh I thought I died in your arms

Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go

Hope you know, I won't let go 


I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust
I know this is love but

If I tell the world
I'll never say enough
Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do
If I'm in love with you

Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere

I'd build myself up
And fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally could this be it or

Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere yeah

Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if, it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up,
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements? Or

Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere


You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too

When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

Time and time again, I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
Even in the daylight when you think that
(I don't see you)
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her


Found myself today singing out your name,
You said I'm crazy,
If I am I'm crazy for you.

Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy,
But it's you who makes me lose my head.

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool.

Tell me to run and I'll race,
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,
And make me crazy for you.
Crazy for you.

Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
I wish you'd come over,
Send me spinning closer to you.

My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favorite mood.

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,
But the more I do,
The crazier I turn into.

Pacing floors and opening doors,
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy,
Because I'm too crazy for you.
Crazy for you


Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
And making up the past
Feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt a figure before

A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh

You can find him sittin' on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life

Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through

There's no way I
Could describe him
What I'll say is
Just what I'm hoping for

But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life


When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal anything
I had no idea of the state we were in

I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before,
Baby please remember me once more

When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know

But I know I have a fickle heart and  a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more

Oh, I gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
In hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me

Why don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more
When will I see you again?


So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry

Forgive me first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why, don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes, it's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring

This love has dried up and stayed behind
And if I stay I'll be alive
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me first love, but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new

Forgive me first love, but I'm too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire
Forgive me first love, forgive me first love, forgive me first love
Forgive me first love forgive me, forgive me first love, forgive me first love


Fool that I am
For falling in love with you
And, fool that I am
For thinking you loved me too

You took my heart
And then played the part of little coquette
All my dreams, they just disappeared
Like the smoke from a cigarette

Fool that I am
For hoping you'd understand
And thinking you
Would listen too
And, oh, the things I had planned

But we couldn't see eye to eye
So, darling, darling, darling,
This is goodbye
But I still care
Fool that I am.
Oh, but I still care
Fool that I am.


Some say, I'll be better without you,
They don't know you like I do,
Or at least as far as I thought I knew
I can't bear this time,
It drags, as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
I know some clothes you left behind.
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity is become undone

But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own,
If this is ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this right,
What if I lose my heart and fail the ?
I won't forgive me if I gave up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Now I'm resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead

But I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

There will be times, we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We almost fall apart and burn up easy
So watch them turn to dust
But nothing will never taint us

I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free
Or will he go back to the place where
He will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath, to sit and wait
I'll be home soon, I won't be late

He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't go, I can't do it on his own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk
I won't go! I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk


Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal you
But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me
I'm in California, dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger, and free
I forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened
It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time

So hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Oooooh anymore (x3)
Anymore

Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore


This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away

It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away

I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away

Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave

Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home

I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away

Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, It's calling me home

I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away


I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And turning my heel and strutting my feet
"Is there anything I can do for you dear?
Is there anyone I could call?"
"No and thank you, please Madam.
I ain't lost, just wandering"

Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of now

I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides

Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united

Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met yea

Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world, yeah
Of my world
Of my world, yeah


Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices
Inside my head

Lay down with me
And tell me no lies
Just hold me closly
Don't patronize

Don't patronize me

'Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't
And even in the dark
These final hours
I will lay down my heart
I will feel the power
But you won't
No, you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me
When you don't
When you don't, yeah

I'll close my eyes
'Cause then I don't see
The love you don't feel
When you're holding me

Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me till then
To give up this fight

And I will give up this fight

'Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't
And even in the dark
These final hours
I will lay down my heart
I will feel the power
But you won't
No, you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me
When you don't
When you don't, ooh don't
You, when you don't, yeah, yeah


I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true.
I fall short each time,
Every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer
Closer and near
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all.
Like a bomb before explosion,
Ticking by your call,
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed,
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees.

But I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried,
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you.

So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper "will you leave your man? "
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me.
I won't stand by you.

Cause I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you!

I ain't yours for no taking,
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong
And ignore the right

When I found a boy who loves me more,
Than you ever did me before.
So stand beside the river you cried
And lay yourself down!
Look how you want me now that I don't need you!


I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your ocean's too
Treat me soft but touch me cool
I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
And kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me

Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down, down

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light

I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do
In your heart I bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone

Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down, down

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light

We play so dirty in the dark
'Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder baby
It only makes it harder baby (harder baby)
Harder baby (harder baby), harder baby

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light

I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you


Hold me closer, one more time
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me, for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters
But you pushed me in
I've seen your face, under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart, more than I do
We were the greatest, me and you

But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you

Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your world around me
And pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn

But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you

Time against us
Miles between us
Heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
Time against us
Miles between us
Heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
I know I left you speechless

I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better for you


I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda run through the blindin' rain
Without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love

I never woulda seen the trouble that I'm in
If it hadn't been for love
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love

Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul

Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul

I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda loaded up a forty-four
Put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes


Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, baby
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door

Well, I've been in town
For just about fifteen
Whole minutes now
Oh, baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walking for miles

But the people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They can't understand
Your grandsons
They won't understand
On top of this
I ain't ever
Gonna understand

Last night she said
Oh, baby
Don't feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned around
Oh, baby
I'm gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
Cuz I left that night
Yeah

Oh, people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They don't understand
In spaceships
They won't understand
And me
I ain't ever
Gonna understand

Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
She had turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, little girl
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door, yeah





I would never lie to you unless you tell me to
Every part of me, all my words to hold
And hold against me, why won't you let it be?

Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights

Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me)

I would never break the rules unless you tell me to
You can read my mind, be it truth or lies
Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be?

Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights

Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me)

Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me

Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights

Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) 


Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Please stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind

I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me

You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
Please don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay

I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me

We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live
And not just survive

That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me


Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again

However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again

However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you

However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
'Cause I love you


When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love 


Go ahead, go ahead and smash it on the floor
Take whatever is left, and take it with you out the door
See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Can't say that it's been that great
No in fact it's been a wasted worried year

[Chorus]
Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way to long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black

Let it out, let it all out
Say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream and shout and say things that are so unkind
Yeah-see if I care, see if I stand firm or if I fall
Cause in the back of my mind, and on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all

[Chorus]

Yeah there's many shades of black

[Chorus]

Cause there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's any shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black

Go ahead...


Right under my feet there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
That I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground
You build me up, then leave me dead

I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love
I'm the only one in love


I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bear my soul

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago


You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other,
Think we'll never match at all, but we do
But we do, but we do, but we do

I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more
I've never known this, never before
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining
You think we would and we do,
But we do, but we do, but we do

Favoritism ain't my thing but,
In this situation I'll be glad

Favoritism ain't my thing but,
In this situation I'll be glad to make an exception

You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other,
Think we'll never match at all, but we do


[Instrumental]


I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But how will you ever know if you never try
There's something new inside my heart
And it grabs like a child whenever we're apart
I see your face under every sky
I find the less I look, more I find
So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want

You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But I'm feeling sun babe when I'm in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me alright
When I'm short of falling

So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want


There will be times
When we'll try to give it up
Bursting out, it seems no doubt that will almost fall apart than burn to pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But without each other, nothing is easy enough

So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
'cause you're the only one I want, yeah
You're the only one
Never gonna leave you
No, I'm never gonna leave you, no


Never been a girl who used to cry
Didn`t show emotions, don`t know why
Didn`t wanna feel the pain inside, I guess

But as the years keep going by,
you came along and changed my mind
I should leave the past behind me,
I should let you find me,
supposed to stay beside me
You were supposed to guide me,
through the ups and downs,
you were always gonna be around until the end

I still think we could
`cause you and me, we`re good
And I`ll tell you why this hurts, 'cause I`m sober


But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has pulled me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough

So I`m gonna get myself another drink
whenever I start to think about you
`cause I do what I really don`t want to
but sometimes my dreams just come through

And when I get there,
to a place where I see you in a kitchen
I stop wishing but that thing and I don`t need you,
I don`t really wanna see you
and I don`t want you to see me,
you would think that I was crazy,
you might think that I wanna be close to you
but I`d rather wanna drink some Whisky
and maybe have a little sip `o wine
`cause right now it`s the only thing that makes me forget you are mine
but right now I am sober

But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has pulled me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough

I still think we could
(I`m not drunk enough)
`cause you and me, we`re good
`cause I`m sober

But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has pulled me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough

(I still think we could)
But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has pulled me through
(`cause you and me we`re good)
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough


Sometimes the hole you left hurts
My heart so bad, it cuts through
The deepest parts of me and fills up my mouth with the words that cry
Out, I'm still trying to stay inside

Hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

Every now and then my memories ache
With empty ideas of the ones we'd have made it
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest

'Cause heart break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here


You've been on my mind
I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows why it's taken me
So long to let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want

I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

If I've been on your mind
You hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll go?

I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy, mm
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it

So I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove that I am the, one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

Come on and give me the chance
To prove that I am the one who can, walk that mile
Until the end starts


Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life, oh

Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me, I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel, leave

I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can start to begin what's begun

Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun

Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories


I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life
This ain't easy it's not meant to be
Every story has its scars

When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy

No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whenever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Your love, it is my truth
And I will always love you
Love you

When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy, oh

When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
I will be, I will be
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be, I will be
Your remedy, oh


Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things

'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Go ahead and still my heart
To make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
We were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game

'Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love


Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me, 'cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain

But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
No, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain

It's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain

So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea


There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling
We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there 'cause mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love remind me of us (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
The scars of your love they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling
We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(You're gonna wish you never had met me) We could've had it all
We could've had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
It all, it all, it all, (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it
To the beat


She, she ain't real
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history
Or don't you remember
Sure, she's got it all
But, baby, is that really what you want

Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you
And, boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt
But you're cold to the core
Now rumor has it she ain't got your love anymore

Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh

She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumors

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And, boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumor has it I'm the one you're leaving her for

Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh

All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it

Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh

But rumor has it he's the one I'm leaving you for


Just the guitar

This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands all over my body and told me, umm
You told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love everlasting you and me
That was what you told me

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

I was too strong you were trembling
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising (rising), umm
Baby I'm so rising
I was running, you were walking
You couldn't keep up, you were falling down (down), umm
There's only one way down

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We've both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

If you're ready, if you're ready
If you're ready, I am ready
If you're ready, if you're ready
We both know we ain't kids no more
No, we ain't kids no more

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts

If you're ready, if you're ready (Send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more


I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name

When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time

Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name

I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time
The last time

Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn


This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again

For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall

Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall

Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall


I heard, that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're, married now

I heard, that your dreams came true
I guess she gave you things
I didn't give to you

Old friend, why are you so shy
Ain't like you to hold back
Or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best
For you too, don't forget me
I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead yeah

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday it was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze bound by the surprise
Of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Nothing compares no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes their memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet
This would taste

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead


With your loving, there ain't nothing
That I can't adore
The way I'm running, with you, honey
Is we can break every low
I find it funny that you're the only
One I never looked for
There is something in your loving
That tears down my walls

I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to

The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known

I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all alone

I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to

The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known

I've been looking for you, baby
In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
All my life, you're my darkness
You're the right kind of madness
And you're my hope, you're my despair
You're my scope, everything, everywhere

The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known

Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Devotion


Didn't I give it all?
Tried my best
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to having me 'round
Still how can you walk away
From all my tears
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here
But go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love

Maybe I should leave, to help you see
Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need
So is it over? Is this really it, you're giving up so easily
I thought you loved me more than this

But go on, go on, take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love

I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust
Oh if only, if only you knew
Everything I do, is for you

But go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all, with my love
Take it all with my love
Take it all with my love


When we used
To say goodnight
I'd always kiss
And hold you tight
But lately
You don't seem
To care
You close the door
And leave me
Standing there
Oh, honey
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on

The other night
We had a date
And you showed up
Two hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Oh, they smeared it
Every place
Yeah, yeah that's it, honey
I quit, I'm movin' on

Oooohhhh

You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all

Baby, I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Sooth me so
If you've got someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
Yeah, that's it, honey
I quit, I'm movin' on

Oooohhhh

You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I can't have you
The way I want you
I don't want you at all

Baby
I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Sooth me so
If you got someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
So that's it
Baby, I quit now
I'm movin' on

So that's it
Baby, I quit
Oh, I'm movin' on


Hold my hand while you cut me down
It had only just begun but now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
The night
When I fell off your mind

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired

Where'd you go when you stayed behind
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired

(I should have known)

Never mind said your open arms
I couldn't help believe they tricked me back into them, even though

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired


Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more

I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you, what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables

Under haunted skies I see you
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
I braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no I will never be knocked down

I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you, what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
Turning tables

Next time I'll be braver
I'll be my own savior
When the thunder calls for me
Next time I'll be braver
I'll be my own savior
Standing on my own two feet

I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you, what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables
Turning tables, yeah
Turning oh


[Instrumental]


Seven days has gone so fast,
I really thought the pain would pass.
It's been nearly an hour,
Since I thought of you.

But your not answering the phone,
I'd settle for a busy tone,
At least that I'd know that you're okay.
A girl like you ain't meant to go away.
Oh

Now you're gone,
There's nothing else I want.
Now that it's over,
There's nothing else I want.
What have I done,
Looks like I was wrong.
Is everything really meant to change,
I guess we're like water and a flame.
Water and a flame

I'm tired of this empty house,
I need a drink to get me out.
A couple more til I forget your name.

I saw a boy that looked like you,
I didn't know quite what to do,
It took a power of will to break my stare.
I realized what I wanted wasn't there.

Now you're gone,
There's nothing else I want.
Now that it's over,
There's nothing else I want.

Is everything really meant to change,
I guess we're like water and a flame.
Water and a flame

If you see me coming
I look away, I look away
And if your mind is made up
I look away, I will look away

If your worry bound
I'm okay, I'm okay, yes I am
All this sorrow and this pain,
Is going to go away

Now you're gone,
There's nothing else I want.
Now that it's over,
There's nothing else I want.
What have I done,
Looks like I was wrong.
Is everything really meant to change,
I guess we're like water and a flame.
Water and a flame


If you're not the one for me
Then I'll come back and bring you to your knees
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh when you found that the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through

It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge


Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me

You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young

It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young


Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me?

Why do you love me?
There must be something in the water
Cause baby I'm in deeper than I knew
How do you keep me coming back for more
After all we've been through
I can't decide if I should run and hide

It's above and beyond me, the start of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breath
Whatever it is, I bleed
Where does the time go?
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you
I can't describe how I feel, it feels right

It's above and beyond me, the start of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

You were a shock in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark and it never will fade
You ignited a spark, let the fires away
Are you ready, ready?
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and dark of my universe
Every piece and part, you were the first
I am ready, ready

It's above and beyond me, the start of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you

It's above and beyond me, the start of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?


In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish I'd said
At the dawning of the day
I can't wait to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the wait take me under
I know I'll survive
You'll never see me again

At the dawning of the day
I can't bare to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the wait take me under
I know I'll survive

Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
I've been learning to live without you
It's taken all of my stake
But I'm stronger now

you have this way of dipping in and out of sight as things collide
bridges burning softly in the night
and you have this way of falling in and out of time as it goes by
passing silently with no goodbye
and ive spoken with all other the angels
they dont know what to do
and i agree with them whole heartedly i do

tellogram came today from a friend saying where in the hell have you been
where are you goin
and i said i dont know does the lonliness show
and if so does it ever end?
and ive spoken with all other the angels
and they dont know what to do
and i agree with them whole heartedly i do

you have this way of meaning everything and nothing to me at the same time
returning my hellos with goodbyes
cause ive spoken with all other the angels
they dont know what to do
and i agree with them whole heartedly i do...

cause ive spoken with all other the angels
they dont know what to do
and i agree with them whole heartedly i do

and ive spoken with all other the angels
they dont know what to do
and i agree with them whole heartedly i do... 



From the moment the lights went off
Everything had changed
Lie awake in an empty room
In my head it all feels the same

Like the taste of the day you left
It still lingers on my breath
And the dampness of tears that left
The stain where you had wept

All alone with the negligee
That still hangs off of my bed
I keep meaning to give it away
But I just leave it there instead

No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

Three more days till I see your face
I'm afraid it's far too much
Cook a meal and fix up the place
Dial your number, hang it up

If I took you for granted
I apologize for acting tough
You're my reason for living
And there's no way I'm giving up, oh

No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

Now, every evening is a bitter fight
And I'm eating home alone on a Friday night
And I know what your friends say
"He's just wasting your love and time."
I will never let you change your mind

No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

Every time I wind up back at your door
Every time I wind up back at your door


I count the ways I let you down
On my fingers and toes but I'm running out
Clever words can't help me now
I grip you tight but you're slipping out

And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first I met you, so in love that night
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry
Beautiful goodbye, bye bye, bye bye
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye),
Your beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye), oh yeah

When did the rain become a storm
When did the clouds begin to form
Yeah we got knocked off course by a natural force
And well, we'll be swimming when it's gone

And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first I met you, so in love that night
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry
Beautiful goodbye, bye bye, bye bye
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye),
Your beautiful goodbye whoa (bye bye, bye bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye), oh yeah

All the pain you try to hide
Shows through your mascara lines as they stream down from your eyes
And let 'em go, let 'em fly
Holding back won't turn back time
Believe me, I've tried

Your eyes were so bright
And I remember your eyes were so bright
I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first I met you, how in love were we that night
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry
Beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye), oh yeah
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye),
Your beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye), whoa
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye), yeah yeah

Beau, oh yeah


I never knew perfection till
I heard you speak, and now it kills me
Just to hear you say the simple things
Now waking up is hard to do
And sleeping's impossible, too
Everything is reminding me of you
What can I do?

It's not right, not okay
Say the word that you say
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
It's better that we break

A fool to let you slip away
I chase you just to hear you say
You're scared and that you think that I'm insane

The city looks so nice from here
Pity, I can't see it clearly
While you're standing there, it disappears
It disappears

It's not right, not okay
Say the word that you say
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
It's better that we break

Saw you sitting all alone
You're fragile, and you're cold
But that's all right
Life these days is getting rough
They've knocked you down and beat you up
But it's just a roller coaster anyway, yeah

It's not right, not okay
Say the word that you say
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
It's better that we break

I'm not fine, not okay
Say the word that you say
Maybe we're better off this way

I'm not fine, and I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
It's better that we break, baby


All alone in my room think of you at a rate that is truly alarming
I keep grouping my memories of you in my head, I pretend that you want me
And I fall asleep and dream of alternate realities
And I put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves me

And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You never go on till I do
And I can't stop thinking about your love

Oh yeah

Can't believe I could think that she would just follow me everywhere I go
I was wrestling with you in my dreams, and wake up making love to a pillow
And I fall asleep and dream of alternate realities
And I put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves me

And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
And you never go on till I do
And I can't stop, and I can't stop

What I would give to have you look in my direction
And I'd give my life to somehow attract your attention
And I touch myself like it's somebody else
Thoughts of you are tattooed on my mind
Let me show you

I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You never go on till I do
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
I can't stop thinking about you
You never go on till I do
And I can't stop thinking about you


You let me violate you,
you let me disgraces you
You let me complicate you, you let me penetrate you.

(Ohhhhhhho)

Help me,don't pop out my inside.
Help me, got no soul to sell.

Help me, the only thing that works for me.
Help me, get away from myself.

I wanna fuck you like an animal.
I wanna feel u from the inside.

And I wanna fuck you like an animal.
My whole existence is flood,
you bring me closer to god.

You can't help my isolation, you can't help the hate it brings,

You can't help my absent of faith,
you can't help my everything.

Help me, turn on my reason. Help me, sex I can smell.

Help me, you make me perfect shape.

Help me, think im somebody else.

I wanna fuck you like an animal.
I wanna feel you from the inside.
I wanna fuck you like an animal.

My whole existence is flood, you bring me closer to god.


Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

Are we taking time or a time out?
I can't take the in between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

Distant when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby tell me how did you get so

Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

Woah yeah
Woah yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
If you wanna leave just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

Distant (oh) when we're kissing (yeah)
Feel so different (yeah)
Baby tell me how did you get so

Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

Woah yeah
Woah yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah (so cold it's colder)
Woah yeah (so cold it's colder)
Woah yeah (so cold it's colder)
I don't understand why you're so cold

Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Trying to stay, and I leave
Saying that you need some time to breath
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four letter word
But the four letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been acting the same
You gotta go, but the way your ass used to be you gold dig every day
I split the four door to the two door 'cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl I tried to give you space

Baby tell me how did you get so cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

(So cold it's colder) woah yeah
(So cold it's colder) woah yeah
So cold it's colder
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
(So cold it's colder) woah yeah
(So cold it's colder) woah yeah
So cold it's colder
I don't understand why you're so cold


Come away little loss come away to the water
To the ones that are waiting only for you
Come away little loss come away to the water
Away from the life that you always knew
We are calling to you
Come away little light
Come away to the darkness
In the shade of the night we'll come looking for you
Come away little light
Come away to the darkness
To the ones appointed to see it through
We are coming for you
We are coming for you

Come away little lamb come away to the water
Give yourself so we might live anew
Come away little lamb come away to the slaughter

To the ones appointed to see this through
We are coming for you
We are coming for you

Come away little lamb come away to the water
To the arms that are waiting only for you
Come away little lamb come away to the slaughter
To the one appointed to see this through

We are coming for you
We are coming for you
We are coming for you
We are coming for you


Looking at the same sky that we used to live under
Are you thinking about the love that I took from us?
When you close your eyes
Do you see me love?
Am I keeping you awake?
Whatcha scared about?
Are you giving up?
When you know, you know, you know

You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry girl
Don't you worry girl
You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry girl
I'll be back for you
So you better wait up
Keeping the bed warm for me
All night putting your whisper on me
Giving that love and emotion that I know
Doesn't really matter what you do
I'll be back for you
Coming back for you, yeah

I know there are millions of miles in between our hearts
But I will come running for you I don't care how far
When you close your eyes
Do you see me love?
Am I keeping you awake?
Whatcha scared about?
Are you giving up?
When you know, you know, you know

You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry girl
Don't you worry girl
You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry girl
I'll be back for you
So you better wait up
Keeping the bed warm for me
All night putting your whisper on me
Giving that love and emotion that I know
Doesn't really matter what you do
I'll be back for you
Coming back for you, yeah

Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry girl
Don't you worry girl
I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry now, now
Don't you worry now

You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry girl
Don't you worry girl
You know that I'm coming back for you (coming back for you)
Don't you worry girl (coming back for you)
I'll be back for you
So you better wait up
Keeping the bed warm for me
All night putting your whisper on me
Giving that love and emotion that I know (Giving that love and emotion that I know)
Doesn't really matter what you do (Doesn't really matter what you do)
I'll be back for you
Coming back for you, yeah


I have told
All of my enemies,
Very polietly,
To go home.
I have seen
All of your remedies,
Now won't you let me, please,
Go home?

I can't find anything to be sad about,
They say I'm doomed, but I feel fine

I have tried
So very hard as hell
To stay away from hell,
And live upstairs.
But when I see
All of your remedies,
I try quite desperately
To go home.

I can't find anything to be sad about,
They say I'm doomed, but I feel fine.
But if I'm sitting here lonely with no one to hold me,
At least I'll have my health.
I'm trying to control myself.

I have told
All of my enemies,
Very polietly,
To go home.
I have seen
All of your remedies,
Now won't you let me, please,
Go home?

I've been acting irresponsibly,
But what could possibly go wrong?
I have choked on all your remedies,
Now won't you let me, please,
Go home?

But if I sit here lonely,
With no one to hold me,
At least I'll have my health.
I'm trying to control myself.

I'm trying to control
Myself.

Here I am waiting, I'll have to leave soon
Why am I holding on?
We knew this day would come, we knew it all along
How did it come so fast?
This is our last night but it's late
And I'm trying not to sleep
'Cause I know, when I wake
I will have to slip away

And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa

Here I am staring at your perfection
In my arms, so beautiful
The sky is getting bright, the stars are burning out
Somebody slow it down
This is way too hard
'Cause I know, when the sun comes up
I will leave, this is my last glance
That will soon be memory

And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa

I never wanted to stop
Because I don't wanna start all over, start all over
I was afraid of the dark
But now it's all that I want, all that I want, all that I want

And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close

And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa

Ooh whoa (yeah), ooh whoa (yeah), ooh whoa (yeah)
Ooh whoa (yeah), ooh whoa (yeah), ooh whoa


Oh yeah, oh yeah

Hey you, don't wanna love you on the telephone
You're hanging up and I am all alone
Baby you got me doing dirt, doing dirt, doing dirt
And now I wanna find you but you're off the run
My heart's exploding like a burning sun
And I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts, when it hurts

Hold me, we're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up when I get inside
So won't you touch me 'cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up baby make it loud

Hey you, say that you're only having fun and then
You call me up at three A-M again
Baby you got me doing dirt, doing dirt, doing dirt
And now all that I got is just a microphone
To let you know that I am all alone
I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts, when it hurts

Hold me, we're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up when I get inside
So won't you touch me 'cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up baby make it loud

Yeah, come on

So right now, I wanna leave with you right now
I wanna be with you all night, in the car let's go
Yeah let's take it home, let's take it home, let's take it home

So right now, I wanna leave with you right now
I wanna be with you all night, in the car let's go
Yeah let's take it home, let's take it home, let's take it home

Hold me, we're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up when I get inside
So won't you touch me 'cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up baby make it loud


Living inside my head pulling my strings
Letting me think I'm in control
Giving you all of my heart was a good start
But it turns out you want my soul

I don't know nothing about that
In fact I don't know nothing at all, yeah
I'm tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong (so wrong)
So tell me what you really want (really want)
'Cause I don't wanna be, no I don't wanna be alone
Ooh, alone now, oh yeah, don't wanna be

(Uh) Pushing me over the edge
Can't forget those things you said
Cut to the bone
Go ahead, take your swing
What did you think?
I was just gonna roll over,oh no

I don't know nothing about that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
I'm tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong (so wrong)
Gotta tell me what you really want (what you want)
'Cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna be alone
Ooh, alone now
I don't wanna be

I'm putting myself on the line
And I'm tired of wasting my time
There's got to be a reason why
She will not talk to me

No I, I don't know nothing 'bout that
In fact I don't know nothing at all, yeah
So tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong (so wrong)
Oh yeah

I don't know nothing about that
In fact I don't know nothing at all, yeah
So tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong (so wrong)

Yeah tell me what you really want (what you want)
'Cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna be alone
Yeah, doin' everything so wrong


Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Slowly fade away

So I start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I have went to my head
Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off you face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

Chorus:
And so Sally can wait
She knows it's too late
As we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows
If it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a Rock 'n' Roll band
Who'll throw it all away

I'm gonna start a revoution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I have went to my head
Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off you face
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

Chorus x2

So Sally can wait
She knows it's too late
As she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
Don't look back in anger
I heard you say
At least not today 


I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
I'm loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
I'm loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

Wasted (wasted)
And the more I drink the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I can't take it
Baby, every place I go reminds me of you

Do you think of me? 
Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends are actin' strange 
They don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
I'm loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
I'm loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

And I every time I go out, yeah
I hear it from this one, I hear it from that one
That you got someone new
Yeah, I see but I don't believe it
Even in my head you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool

Do you think of me? 
Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends are actin' strange
They don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
I'm loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
I'm loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

No more, please stop
No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
No more tryin' make me jealous on your birthday
You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this?
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?
Matter fact, never mind, we gon' let the past be
May be his right now, but your body's still me, woah

I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
I'm loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
I'm loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh

Who's taking you home, home, home, home
I'm loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
I'm loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know


Sometimes I'm right and I can be wrong
My own beliefs are in my song
The butcher, the banker, the drummer and then
Makes no difference what group I'm in

I am everyday people, yeah yeah

There is a blue one who can't accept the green one
For living with a fat one trying to be a skinny one
And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo

Oh sha sha we got to live together

I am no better and neither are you
We are the same whatever we do
You love me you hate me you know me and then
You can't figure out the bag I'm in

I am everyday people, yeah yeah

There is a long hair that doesn't like the short hair
For bein' such a rich one that will not help the poor one
And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo

Oh sha sha we got to live together

There is a yellow one that won't accept the black one
That won't accept the red one that won't accept the white one
And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo

I am everyday people


You and me and all that wine
Loosen my tie, lie down, let's fly
Every guy that passes by
(Look at her, look at her oh)
And you say that it's not right
But where does he think you are tonight?
Does he know your nasty side?
(Look at her, look at her oh)

If you want me take me home and let me use you
I know he doesn't satisfy you like I do
And does he know that there's nobody quite like you
So let me tell you all the things he never told you
(Yeah)

I got these feelings for you
And I can't help myself no more
Can't fight these feelings for you
No, I can't help myself no more
I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I

You and me let's go all night
Going so high, we fuck the sky
Come with me now, fuck that guy
(Look at her, look at her oh)
Now you flash that sexy smile
And tell me I've got to wait a while
And it makes me lose my mind
(Look at her, look at her oh)

If you want me take me home and let me use you
I know he doesn't satisfy you like I do
And does he know that there's nobody quite like you
So let me tell you all the things he never told you
(Yeah)

I got these feelings for you
And I can't help myself no more
Can't fight these feelings for you
No, I can't help myself no more
I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I
(Can't help myself no more)
I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I

No, I can't wait much longer
It needs to happen now
'Cause I can't spend the rest of my life chasing you around
I want to get much closer
You need to tell me how
Baby, how, how
Babe, 'cause I

I got these feelings for you
And I can't help myself no more
Can't fight these feelings for you
No, I can't help myself no more

I got these feelings for you
(Got these feelings for ya, got these feelings for ya)
Can't fight these feelings for you
No, I can't help myself no more
I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I
It's fine


I'm happy you came to me first
Before the bubble burst
I'm happy you answered my calls
I'm bouncing off the walls
Impossible to be tamed 
Her need- cellophane 
I'm happy you like to play games 
Why did you run away?

We could spend some time together
What he had he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see your getting it
So let's figure it out let's go. 

I'm happy you're so impulsive
Means that your passionate
I'm happy you're moving so fast
But will it ever last 
I know you wanna break free
From this monotony
I'm happy you're coming with me
But by choice it's gotta be

We can spend some time together
What he has he'll never know 
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see your getting it

So figure it out let's go

I'm happy you're changing your speed
Slow down and lay with me 
On bottom but always discrete
Kneel down and kiss her feet
I'm happy your going too far
Full strength before we start
Sometimes you make it so hard 
Scream loud as we come apart

We can spend some time together
What he had he'll never know 
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see your getting it
So figure it out let's go

We can spend some time together
What he has he'll never know 
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see your getting it
So figure it out let's go
Figure it out let's go
Figure it out let's go
Figure it out let's
Go

I'm not a fortune teller, I won't be bringing news
Of what tomorrow brings, I'll leave that up to you
I'm not a fortune teller, don't have a crystal ball
I can't predict the future, can't see nothing at all

It doesn't mean I'm afraid of all the things that you say
But I just think we should stay stuck in the moment today
And as the seasons roll by, no matter how hard I try
Summer will end and the leaves will turn again

I don't know why you're acting like this
I don't know why you had to do it again
Why'd you have to go and ruin the night
Don't worry about tomorrow's mess

I never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change, but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller

I don't like watching TV, I don't know what it all means
And your American dream, baby it just isn't me
I know that what I'm thinking may not be on your mind
I know the song I'm singing is not your favorite kind

It doesn't mean I'm afraid of all the things that you say
But I just think we should stay stuck in the moment today
And as the seasons roll by, no matter how hard I try
Summer will end and the leaves will turn again

I don't know why you're acting like this
I don't know why you had to do it again
Why'd you have to go and ruin the night
Don't worry about tomorrow's mess

I never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change, but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller

This feeling keeps growing
These rivers keep flowing
How can I have answers
When you drown me in questions

I never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change, but I want you to stay
And I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller

I'll never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I never change, but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller



Funky
is the word,
You're right,
Or grow strong,
Funky is the word.

Oh, this is so funky,
Funky in my heart,
This girl is funky,
The girl in my dreams cracks me up.

Funky, oh that's the word, 
But Jane, do you really care how funky styles of your could be?
Can you just see me lone-ly?
Funky is the word you could only say.

It's so funky,
Jane, can't you see?
You could be loved by any boy in the world,
Funky, it's the word. 

The word is funky,
The word is funky,
Oh how a shame,
It's too funky.


You are relentless, I am defenseless
Why did you knock me down tonight
You beat me senseless, I just don't get this
How many times do I have to try

Your whisper, so clear
The world disappears
As I fall into the darkness
It's impossible to express
How good it feels
I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed
So tight I'll never be free
I'm not gonna fight the feeling

Get back in my life
Come knock on my door
What I'm looking for, I think you should know
You started a fire, burned me to the floor
Please don't resist anymore
I'll never leave you alone
Oh yeah yeah yeah

You reprimand me, you're so demanding
But I've got time, I don't mind at all
You're picture perfect, completely worth it
You've got my back against the wall

Your whisper, so clear
The world disappears
As I fall into the darkness
Impossible to express
How good it feels
I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed
So tight I'll never be free yea
I'm not gonna fight the feeling

Get back in my life
Come knock on my door
What I'm looking for, I think you should know
You started a fire, burned me to the floor
Please don't resist anymore
I'll never leave you alone

Can you feel me coming
I'm screaming, searching, calling
Paranoid,
Cause I'm always coming back to you,
Coming back to you
And you know how much I missed it
And you know I can't resist it
See your lips and just come running
Right on back to you, right on back to you

Get back in my life, come knock on my door
What I'm looking for, I think you should know
You started a fire, burned me to the floor
I can't do this anymore
I'll never leave you alone

(Get back in my life)
Get back in my life
(come knock on my door)
Woo!
(What I'm looking for)
C'mon now
I think you should know)

(Get back in my life)
Yea yea yea
(come knock on my door) oh
(What I'm looking for)
I'll never leave you alone
(I think you should know)

(Get back in my life) Oh
(come knock on my door)
(What I'm looking for)
Yea yea yea
(I think you should know)

(Get back in my life)
(come knock on my door)
(What I'm looking for)
(I think you should know)


Now you've been bad, and it goes on and on and on
'Til you come home babe, 'til you come home
You taste past the poison, you learned to love is gone
I'm all alone baby, I'm all alone

I'm waiting for something, always waiting
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change
And then I give a little more, oh babe
Oh, I give a little more, oh babe

I'm not fallin' in love with ya, I'm not fallin' in love
And I'm not fallin' in love with ya, I'm not fallin' in love
'Til I get a little more from you baby
Oh, get a little more from you babe

You were wrong for turning me on and on and on
And on and on, yeah
You make it so hard

I'm waiting for something, always waiting
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change (if it'll ever change)
Then I give a little more, oh babe
Oh, give a little more, oh babe

I'm not fallin' in love with ya, I'm not fallin' in love
And I'm not gonna love with ya, I'm not gonna love
'Til I get a little more from you baby
I get a little more from you babe

I have no defense
I know you're gonna get me in the end
And I cannot pretend
I never wanna feel this way again

I'm not fallin' in love with ya, I'm not fallin' in love
And I'm not fallin' in love with ya, I'm not fallin' in love
'Til I get a little more from you baby
Oh, get a little more from you babe

I'm not gonna love with ya, I'm not gonna love
And I'm not gonna love with ya, I'm not fallin' in love
'Til I get a little more from you baby
Oh, get a little more from you babe


You left me hanging from a thread we once swung from together
I licked my wounds, but I can't ever see them getting better
Something's gotta change
Things cannot stay the same

Her hair was pressed against her face
Her eyes were red with anger
Enraged by things unsaid, and empty beds, and bad behavior
Something's gotta change
It must be rearranged, oh

I'm sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Hope that things work out all right, yeah, whoa, whoa

The room was silent as we all tried so hard to remember
The way it feels to be alive
The day that he first met her
Something's gotta change
Things cannot stay the same

You make me think of someone wonderful, but I can't place her
I wake up every morning wishing one more time to face her
Something's gotta change
It must be rearranged, oh

I'm sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Hope that things work out all right

So much to love
So much to learn
But I won't be there to teach you, oh
I know I can be close
But I try my best to reach you

I'm so sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of a heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Hope that things work out all right, yeah, whoa, oh, yeah


Put your hands all over,
Put your hands all over me,
Put your hands all over,
Put your hands all over me
(Put your hands all over me)

I can't seem to find
A pretty little face I left behind
Wandered out on the open road
Looking for a better place to call home

Gave her a place to stay
And she got up and ran away
And now I've had enough
A pretty little face has torn me up

Put your hands all over me
Please talk to me, talk to me
Tell me everything, is gonna be alright

Put your hands all over me
Please walk with me, walk with me now
Love is a game you say
Play me and put me away
(Put your hands all over me)
Oh

Now you've lost your mind
A pretty little girl I left behind
And now you're getting rough
But everybody knows you're not that tough

She wandered out on the open road
Looking for a place to call your own
You're scared to death of the road ahead
Pretty little thing don't get upset

Put your hands all over me
Please talk to me, talk to me
Tell me everything is gonna be alright
(gonna be alright)

Put your hands all over me
Please walk with me, walk with me now
Love is a game you say, play me and put me away
Love is a game you say, play me and put me away

Put your hands all over me, ooh, woo
Put your hands all over me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Put your hands all over me, ooh (All over me)

So come down off your cloud
Say it now and say it loud
Get up in my face
Pretty little girl, come make my day

Put your hands all over me
Please talk to me, talk to me girl
Put your hands all over me
Gotta walk with me, walk with me now (come on, woo)

Put your hands all over me
Gotta talk to me, talk to me (come on now babe)
Put your hands all over me (woo)
Gotta walk with me, walk with me

Love is a game you say, play me and put me away
Love is a game you say, play me and put me away

(Put your hands all over me)
Yeah (All over me)

Put your hands all over
Put your hands all over me


So this is Christmas
And what have you done
Another year over
And a new one just begun

And so this is Christmas
I hope you have fun
The near and the dear ones
The old and the young

A very Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

And so this is Christmas
For weak and for strong
The rich and the poor ones
The world is so wrong

And so Happy Christmas
For black and for white
For yellow and red ones
Let's stop all the fight

A very Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

And so this is Christmas
And what have we done
Another year over
A new one just begun

And so Happy Christmas
We hope you have fun
The near and the dear ones
The old and the young

A very Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

War is over
If you want it
War is over now


How dare you say that my behavior is unacceptable
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step 'cause if I do you'll need a miracle

You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground I'm walking on

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

Does it kill
Does it burn
Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control

Does it thrill
Does it sting
When you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe


Well I don't feel as if I know you
You take up all my time
The days are long and the nights will throw you away
'Cause the sun won't shine

Nobody ever mentions the weather to make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember, life is a game we play

We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
'Cause the years are fallin' by like the rain
It's never gonna be the same
Until' my mind's knew, comes to my house and says
Hello

There ain't no sense in feeling lonely
They got no faith in you
But I've got a feeling, you still owe me
So wipe from your shoes

Nobody ever mentions the weather to make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember, the life is a game we play

We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
'Cause the years are fallin' by like the rain
It's never gonna be the same
Until' my mind's knew, comes to my house and says
Hello, hello

Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
Oh yeah


Living easy, lovin' free
Season ticket on a one-way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I would rather do
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too

I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell

No stop signs, speedin' limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me 'round
Hey Satan! Paid my dues
Playin' in a rockin' band
Hey Mama! Look at me
I'm on my way to the promise land

I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell

Don't stop me!

I'm on the highway to hell!
I'm on the highway to hell!
I'm on the highway to hell!
I'm on the highway to hell!

And I'm goin' down, all the way!
I'm on the highway to hell


I have been searching for your touch
Unlike any touch I've ever known

And I never thought about you much
Till I'm broken down and all alone

No I don't understand the meaning of love
I do not mind if I die trying, oh

Took you for granted
When you lifted me up

I'm asking for your help
I am going through hell
Afraid nothing can save me
But the sound of your voice

You cut out all the noise
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly, now
I'd kill if I could take you back
But how?
But how?

I can feel it in my guts
What's going on with him now

Don't patronize me with lies
I'ma man, be a woman now

I have been bound by the shackles of love
And I don't mind if I die tied up

Took you for granted
When you lifted me up

I'm asking for your help
I am going through hell
Afraid nothing can save me
But the sound of your voice

You cut out all the noise
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now
I'd kill if I could take you back
But how?
But how?
But how?
But how?

Why must we be so ugly
And please do not speak ill of me
Why does the one you love
Become the one who makes you want to cry

And why?
Why?
Why?

No I don't understand the meaning of love
I do not mind if I die trying
I do not mind if I die trying
I do not mind if I die trying


I must have been a fool
To love you so hard for so long
So much stronger than before
But so much harder to move on
And now the bitter chill of the winter
Still blows through me like a plague
Only to wake up with an empty bed
On a perfect summer day

My world just feels so cold
And you find yourself walking down
The wrong side of the road
Ow!

I can't lie your on my mind, stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday

I never did my best to express how I really felt
And now that I know exactly what I want
You found somebody else

Ooh my world just feels so cold
And you find yourself walking on
The wrong side of the road
Oh yeah

I can't lie your on my mind stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday

(Ah la la la la la la la, yeah)
(Ah la la la la la la la, yeah)
(Ah la la la la la la la, oh)
(Ah la la la la la la la, yeah)

My world just feels so cold
And I find myself thinking about the things I could have done
And it warms my soul when you let me know
I'm not the only one

I can't lie your on my mind, stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday

I can't lie your on my mind, stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday

(I can't lie your on my mind, stuck inside my head)
(I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah)
(I just die so much inside now that you're not there)
(I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday)


all alone in my room think of you at a rate that is truly alarming
and i keep grouping my memories of you in my head
I can tell that you want me

and i fall asleep and dream of alternate realities
and i put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves me

and i can't stop thinking about you
and i can't stop thinking about you
and you never know girl, what i do
and i cant stop thinking about you, love

i can't see, can't believe that she would just follow me everywhere I go
so i was wrestling you in my dreams and wake up making love to a pillow


and i fall asleep and dream of alternate realities
and i put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves me

and i can't stop thinking about you
and i can't stop thinking about you
and you never know girl, what i do
and i cant stop, and i can't stop

what i would give to have you look in my direction
and id give my life to somehow attract your attention
see i'd touch myself like it's somebody else
but you are like tatooes on my mind let me show you



Yeah yeah, oh
Some people live for the fortune
Some people live for the fame
Some people live for the power yeah
Some people live just to play the game
Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before
But that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
If everything means nothing
If I ain't got you yeah

Some people search for a fountain
Promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them

Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
With no one to share,
No one who truly cares for me

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you you you

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you

If I ain't got you with me baby
There ain't nothing in this whole wide world doesn't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me baby yeah
Yeah!


If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you


If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her


If I trust in you oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you


Now as the summer fades, I'll let you slip away
You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway
It makes me burn to learn you're not the only one
I'll let you be if you put down your blazing gun

Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you)

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

Sometimes you move so well it's hard not to give in
I'm lost; I can't tell where you end and I begin
It makes me burn to learn you're with another man
I wonder if he's half the lover that I am

Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you)

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

Baby, baby, please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind
(Promise not to leave me behind)

Take me back, but take it easy
Make me think, but don't deceive me
Talk to me by taking your time
(Talk to me, talk to me)

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

(Talk to me, talk to me)

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight


I wake up
Thoughts of you
Tattooed to my mind
As I wonder
What to wear
What to eat
Who to be
Will I see you again

And as my car breaks down
I shake my head and say
What a day


If you only knew
What I went through just to get to you
I'm hanging from you
And I'll hold on if you want me to

Every bus, every train,
Ever cab, every lane is JAMMED
So I look to the sky
And I reach for the planes with my hands

If all my days go wrong
I'll think about last night
It went right

If you only knew
What I went through just to get to you
I'm hanging from you
And I'll hold on if you want me to

If you only knew
What I went through just to get to you
I'm swinging from you
And there's nothing I would rather do


Say what you're mad at me for, me for
Yeah why you talk that evil, yeah
That's not the way you show love, show love
No love, no love, no no
Say what you're crying at me for, me for
Try to control your ego, yeah
That's not the way you show love, show love
No love, no love, no no

'Cause I got all the things I wanna say
But nothing's coming out
And all the times I came to you
I never ever lied
Show me that phone in your pocket girl
Show me that phone in your pocket
So wait you think that I don't know what this is really all about
It should be really easy
If you have nothing to hide
Show me that phone in your pocket girl
Show me that phone in your pocket

So what you spying on me for, me for
Tell me what you're looking for, yeah
This shit you're saying is so low, so low
No love, no love, no no
But tell me where did you go, you go
When you saying need time alone, yeah
You really think I don't know, don't know
I know, I know, I know

'Cause I got all the things I wanna say
But nothing's coming out
And all the times I came to you
I never ever lied
Show me that phone in your pocket girl
Show me that phone in your pocket
So wait you think that I don't know what this is really all about
It should be really easy
If you have nothing to hide
Show me that phone in your pocket girl
Show me that phone in your pocket

Show me yours, I'll show you mine
I'll show you mine
Show me yours, I'll show you mine
I'll show you mine
Show me yours, I'll show you mine
I'll show you mine
I'll show you mine
Yeah

I can't believe you looked me in the eye
And said to me you had nothing to hide
Yeah
Now you're dead to me, this really is goodbye
Goodbye

'Cause I got all the things I wanna say
But nothing's coming out
And all the times I came to you
I never ever lied
Show me that phone in your pocket girl
Show me that phone in your pocket
So wait you think that I don't know what this is really all about
It should be really easy
If you have nothing to hide
Show me that phone in your pocket girl
Show me that phone in your pocket

Show me yours, I'll show you mine
I'll show you mine
Show me yours, I'll show you mine
I'll show you mine
Show me yours, I'll show you mine
I'll show you mine
Show me that phone in your pocket


Baby, I don't want to spend my life on trial
For something that I did not do
And maybe if you stopped and looked around some time
I wouldn't pass right by you

Maybe it's because you are so insecure
Maybe your plain don't care
Maybe it's the chase that really gets me off
I fall so when it's just not there

Burn another bridge, break another heart
Try again, it will only fall apart

Infatuation
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
It's such a shame that you shot me down
It would have been nice to be around
I'm touching your skin
If it's only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?
I guess this must be infatuation (I want it)

Try to put my finger on what burns me up
It always seems to escape me
And when you have decided that you've had enough
Just tell me where I need to be

Now her face is something that I never had
To ever deal with before
She left me with the feeling that she'd had enough
And I'm the one wanting more

Burn another bridge, break another heart
Try again, it will only fall apart

Infatuation
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
It's such a shame that you shot me down
It would have been nice to be around
I'm touching your skin
If it's only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?
I guess this must be infatuation (I want it)

I'm so attracted to you
The feeling's mutual too
And I get scared the moment you leave
Get so hot I forget to breathe, yeah

Infatuation
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
It's such a shame that you shot me down
It would have been nice to be around
I'm touching your skin
If it's only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?
I guess this must be infatuation (I want it)

Oh (I want it)
Oh (I want it)
Yeah (I want it)


I won't let anybody hurt you
And I'll stop them if they try to
Nobody knows you like I do baby

And I don't care where you run to
Because I am going to find you
When the stars all align, we can try again

Whoa-oh
Is anybody out there?
Whoa-oh
Can anybody see?
Whoa-oh
Seems like everything is going crazy-y-y
Whoa-oh
You're exactly what I wanted
Whoa-oh
And exactly what I need
Whoa-oh
Don't need anybody but my baby-y-y

So where did all your love go?
You played me like a solo
Then you threw my broken heart away-y-y

And I know that we can make it
And the closer I can feel it
So stop foolin' around and just stay-y-y

Whoa-oh
Is there anybody out there?
Whoa-oh
Can anybody see?
Whoa-oh
Seems like everything is going crazy-y-y
Whoa-oh
You're exactly what I wanted
Whoa-oh
You're exactly what I need
Whoa-oh
Don't need nobody but my baby-y-y

[PJ Morton]
It's taken such a long time
To find what I've been looking for
And now that you're all mine
I've never felt quite like this before
Still want more
Are you reading my mind?

Because if so, then you already know
You're all that I want and all that I needed

Yeah-ah-ah

[Adam]
Whoa-oh
Is anybody out there?
Whoa-oh
Can anybody see?
Whoa-oh
It seems like everything is going crazy-y-y
Whoa-oh
You're exactly what I wanted
Whoa-oh
And you're exactly what I need
Whoa-oh
Don't need anybody but my baby-y-y

Whoa-oh
Is there anybody out there
Whoa-oh
Can anybody see?
Whoa-oh
Seems like everything is going crazy-y-y
Whoa-oh
You're exactly what I wanted
Whoa-oh
And you're exactly what I need
Whoa-oh
Don't need nobody but my baby-y-y


Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling, oh

Searching for the meaning, oh

Hazel eyes, I was so color blind

Only friends in my mind, but now I realize

I watched you cry
Bathed in sunlight
By the bathroom door
You said you wished you did not love me anymore

You left your flowers in the backseat of my car
The things we said and did have left permanent scars
Obsessed depressed at the same time
I can't even walk in a straight line
I've been lying in the dark no sunshine
No sunshine
No sunshine

She cries
This is more than goodbye
When I look into your eyes
You're not even there
It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Oh yeah

I can't believe that it's over
(Just a feeling)
(Just a feeling that I have)
(Just a feeling)
(Just a feeling that I have)
You've hit your low
You've lost control and you want me back
You may not believe me but I gave you all I have
Oh just confess that you're still mine
I roll around in a bed full of tears and
I'm still lying in the dark no sunshine
No sunshine
No sunshine

She cries this is more than goodbye
When I look into your eyes you're not even there

It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have

No I can't believe that it's over now baby
(Just a feeling)
(Just a feeling that I have)
(Just a feeling)
(Just a feeling that I have)
So much to say
It's not the way she does her hair
It's the way she seems to stare right through my eyes
And in my darkest day when she refused to run away
The love she tried so hard to save

It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have

It's just a feeling
It's just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have

I can't believe that it's over
(Just a feeling)
(Just a feeling that I have)
I can't believe that it's over
(Just a feeling)
(Just a feeling that I have)
I can't believe that it's over yeah


You don't have to be beautiful
To turn me on
I just need your body baby
From dusk till dawn
You don't need experience
To turn me out
You just leave it all up to me
I'm gonna show you what it's all about

You don't have to be rich
To be my girl
You don't have to be cool
To rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss

You got to not talk dirty, baby
If you want to impress me
You can't be to flirty, mama
I know how to undress me (Yeah)
I want to be your fantasy
Maybe you could be mine
You just leave it all up to me
We could have a good time

You don't have to be rich
To be my girl
You don't have to be cool
To rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss!

Women not girls rule my world
I said they rule my world
Act your age, mama (Not your shoe size)
Not your shoe size
Maybe we could do the twirl
You don't have to watch Dynasty
To have an attitude
You just leave it all up to me
My love will be your food, yeah

You don't have to be rich
To be my girl
You don't have to be cool
To rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss!


You're such a flirt, I know you hurt
And so do I, I empathize
I see you out, you never cared
A conversation that we never shared

But it's so strange, it's something new
Amazing feelings that I have for you
I close my eyes when I'm alone
Wonder what it'd be like to make you moan

I wanna give you something better
Than anything you've ever had
A stronger and a faster lover
The world it disappears so fast

Sweet Kiwi
Your juice is dripping down my chin
So please let me
Don't stop it before it begins

So give it up, and don't pretend
And spread your arms and legs across the bed
And when you shake, you won't regret
The things I whisper in your ear
(What?) I said

I wanna give you something better
(You wanna give me something better)
Than anything you've ever had
(Than anything I've ever had)
A stronger and a faster lover
(A stronger and a faster lover)
The world it disappears so fast
(It disappears so fast)

Sweet Kiwi
Your juice is dripping down my chin
So please let me
Don't stop it before it begins

I can't wait to take you home
Fingers through your hair
Kisses on your back
Scratch me with your nails
Save me from myself
Show me how to care
Get everything out
Dripping everywhere
Lipstick smeared all over your face
How much longer must we wait?
Don't think that I can wait

Sweet Kiwi
Your juice is dripping down my chin
So please let me
Don't stop it before it begins

(Hey, yeah)

Sweet Kiwi (wanna give you something better than this)
Your juice is dripping down my chin (hey)
So please let me (wanna give you something better than this)
Don't stop it before it begins

Don't stop it before it begins
Don't stop it before it begins
Don't stop it before it begins
Don't stop it before it begins


Baby it's not alright
The second that you turn your back she'll be outta sight
Baby she'll break your heart
The second that you spend the night apart
How could you do it?
Oh, how could you walk away, from everything we made
How could you do it?
Oh you better watch yourself, I think that girl's insane

Ooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooh
It's like a cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller

Baby she'll eat you live
As soon as she smells your blood in the water
You better run to survive
Before she makes you her latest slaughter
How could you do it?
Oh, just come back to me, baby I'm begging please
How could you do it?
Oh she knows I love you still, you're just her latest kill

Ooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooh
It's like a cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller

Ooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooh
It's like a cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller

Ooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooh
It's like a cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller


I'm sure that he could give you everything
Stability and diamond rings
All the things I do not have
I understand you can't handle that
But for everything that I lack
I provide something you almost had
Hot flesh that you yearn to grab
Pit of your stomach you're still so sad

So oh, what you gonna do.
I'm in love with you
Don't you wanna dance
This might be the last chance
That I get, to love you, oh oh oh

Out of sight, not out of mind
You want the world, I'll give you mine
'Cause you're the girl I'll never find
And I'm the boy you left behind
I know you think you're satisfied
And God knows how hard we tried
But if you showed up at my door
I could give you so much more oh

Oh, what you gonna do
I'm in love with you
Don't you wanna dance
This may be the last chance
That I get, to love you, oh oh oh

Oh, what am I gonna do
I don't have to lose
You're not making sense
This might be the last chance
That you get to love me, oh

You sure don't make it easy
To get myself to safety
You tell me that I'm crazy
But you're the one who makes me this way
You call me so impulsive
But that's what makes us so explosive

So as I burn these photographs
I wonder if you kept the ones you have
Keep them locked up somewhere safe
Since it's the only place you'll see my face

Oh, what you gonna do
I'm in love with you
Why don't you wanna dance
'Cause this might be the last chance
That I get to love you, oh oh oh
Oh, what am I gonna do
I don't like to lose
You're not making sense
'Cause this may be the last chance
That you get to love me, oh

This may be the last chance that I get to love you, oh
This may be the last chance that I get to love you, oh oh oh
To love you, oh oh oh


You got in so late
It's Sunday morning
Said that you were leaving
Letting go of us
Where did we go wrong, oh
And now you say you're leaving California
Gotta head back East and want to leave tonight
Pack your things and go, oh
But if you run away
I won't be alright

Even if the sun crashes into us
I won't let go, I won't let go
And I can be your light
Stay with me tonight
I won't let go, I won't let go
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, yeah yeah yeah

Pick up all the pieces
Fight to hold on
Put them back together, do it all for love, oh
Never let it go
Oh yeah, hm
'Cause I don't need a reason
Just to hold ya
One more of your teasing
Look you in the eyes, oh
Oh baby please don't go
Oh yeah
But if you run
Away I won't be alright

Even if the sun crashes into us
I won't let go, I won't let go
And I can be your light
Stay with me tonight
I won't let go, I won't let go
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, yeah yeah yeah

Now you say you're leaving California


I, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is all right with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
And I want to spend my life with you

Since, since we've been together
Loving you forever
Is what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue

Let's, let's stay together
Lovin' you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

Why, why some people break up
Then turn around and make up
I just can't see
You'd never do that to me (would you, baby)
Staying around you is all I see
(Here's what I want us to do)

Let's, we oughta stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad


I'm sick of picking the pieces
And second-guessing
My reasons why you don't trust me
Why must we do this to one another?

We are just passionate lovers
With trouble under the covers
Nothing worse than when
You know that it's over

I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

Please don't leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?

Well, I've got nothing to hide
Dip down and come for a ride
I'm a racy devil, so sly
You cannot hear him coming

'Cause my defenses are weak
I have no breath left to speak
So take the evidence
And bury it somewhere

I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

Please don't leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?

Oh my, I don't mind being the other guy
Nice try, for these games I do not have the time
If you want me, call me
Come and take a risk kiss
Leave somewhere deep under the surface

I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

Please don't leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?


It's so hard to find you
I'm standing right behind you
The streets are much colder
This mean I'm getting older

Why would you? How could I?
These questions lead to goodbye
But now I got my freedom
Don't I?

I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I've finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified, I think that I may be losing my mind

Shy girl, so humble
With eyes that make me stumble
Somehow not speaking lets me know everything
I go out, you eat in
Hide from the situation
You're naked in daylight
Wrap yourself up and goodnight

I'm burning, I'm hungry
Angry 'cause she don't love me
You've got me completely
In my own game, you beat me

I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I've finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified, I think that I may be losing my mind

I will be back again
No this is not the end
I've fallen hard this time but I not giving in
I want the world to know that I won't let you forget
The tears that you shed
I'll make it impossible to let go

I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I've finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified, I think that I may be losing my mind

I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I've finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified, I think that I may be losing my mind


Please don't see
Just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
Please see me
Reaching out for someone I can't see

Take my hand, let's see where we wake up tomorrow
Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand
I'll be damned, Cupid's demanding back his arrow
So let's get drunk on our tears

And God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

Who are we?
Just a speck of dust within the galaxy?
Woe is me
If we're not careful turns into reality

But don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
Turn the page, maybe we'll find a brand new ending
Where we're dancing in our tears

And God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

And I thought I saw you out there crying oohoo
And I thought I heard you call my name yeah yay yay
And I thought I heard you out there crying
No, just the same oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

God, give us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

And I thought I saw you out there crying oohoo
And I thought I heard you call my name oohoo
And I thought I heard you out there crying
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?


I know your insides are feeling so hollow
And it's a hard pill for you to swallow, yeah
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same

I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you can take me all the way, if you take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you can take me all the way, you can take me all the way

You're such a hard act for me to follow
Love me today don't leave me tomorrow, yeah
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same

I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But take me all the way, if you can take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you can take me all the way, if you can take me all the way

Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh

I don't know where to start, I'm just a little lost
I wanna feel like we're never gonna ever stop
I don't know what to do, I'm right in front of you
Asking you to stay, you should stay, stay with me tonight, yeah

I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But take me all the way, if you can take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But take me all the way, if you can take me all the way

Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh

Take me all the way, if you take me all the way yeah


When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
A lovely day

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
A lovely day

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
A lovely day


You're such a motivator, I gotta get you here
So sick of saying yes sir, yes sir
You're such an instigator, you wanna play the game
Take it or leave it, that's her, that's her

And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
You're body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike

Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) You're body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike

Stuck in her elevator, she take me to the sky
And I don't wanna go down, go down
She said I'll feel you later, go ahead and fantasize
She'll make me want her right now, right now

And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
You're body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike

Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) You're body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike

Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake
Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake

Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) You're body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike

My lucky strike, my lucky strike
(Oh) You're body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million


I wake up, with blood-shot eyes
Struggled to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
Feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that
After that
Try to get you back

I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you

Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye

God damn, my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind; make your move
Forget about the truth

I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you

Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try (yeah)
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye

I've been here before
One day I'll wake up
And it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning
'Cause...

I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you and I...
And so this is goodbye

Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye
So this is goodbye, yeah
So this is goodbye, yeah
So this is goodbye, yeah


I miss the taste of the sweet life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh baby why did you run away?

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder where were you
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
'Cause something strange has come over me
Now I can't get over you
No I just can't get over you

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder where were you
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh

Oh I was there for you
Oh In you darkest times
Oh I was there for you
Oh In your darkest nights

Oh I was there for you
Oh In you darkest times
Oh I was there for you
Oh In your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder where were you
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following


Oh yeah
Oh yeah
So scared of breaking it
That you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters
I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much
Deeper then they seem
You'd rather cover up
I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be
And I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back

Your salty skin and how
It mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be
Completely intertwined
It's not that I didn't care
It's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel,
It's what I didn't show
So let me be
And I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back

You say your faith is shaken
You may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and
Waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused
So far away from you
I'm getting there
Don't care where I have to run

Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah

I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back

Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back

(Girl you really got me bad)
(You really got me bad)
(I'm gonna get you back)
(Gonna get you back)


This has not been easy
This has been hard
I am scarred
And I do not know what to do with you.

Go inside, kiss your mouth with my lips
Grab your hips, can't remember why I fell in love with this

But I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no
You beg me, you ask me to kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again, oh no
I don't need you tonight

Who do you think you are?
No one cares about a name without a face
So don't go shooting up the place
Make no mistake, your love's not real
'Cause the love that I've got is deeper, so much deeper than you could ever feel

And I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you cant stay away from me this time, oh no
You beg me, you ask me to kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again, oh no
'Cause I don't need you tonight

It was really nice to know you
But, there's nothing left to show you
I got bills to pay, get out the way, it's time to move on
And dinner with your boyfriend, will never be the same again
Discuss me over cigarettes and say to him

I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no
You beg me, you ask me
To kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again
So oh no, 'cause I don't need you
And I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no
You beg me, you ask me to
Kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again
So no no, 'cause I won't need you


Just shoot for the stars if it feels right
And aim for my heart if you feel like it
Take me away and make it okay
I swear I'll behave

You wanted control so we waited
I put on a show now we're naked
You say I'm a kid my ego is big
I don't give a shit and it goes like this

Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you all the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you with them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

Baby it's hard when you feel like
You're broken and scarred
Nothing feels right, but when you're with me
I make you believe that I've got the key

Oh, so get in the car we can ride it
Wherever you want get inside it
And you want to steer, but I'm shifting gear
I'll take it from here oh yeah yeah and it goes like this

Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you all the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you with them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

You want to know how to make me smile
Take control, own me just for the night
But if I share my secret you're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this

So watch and learn I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh baby, rub me right
But if I share my secret you're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this

And it goes like this

Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you all the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you with them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger


I've been the needle and the thread
Weaving figure eights and circles around your head
I try to laugh but cry instead
Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said

Fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry

I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing till dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

"This is not goodbye," she said,
"It's just time for me to rest my head."
She does not walk, she runs instead
Down these jagged streets and into my bed

When I was fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry

I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing till dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

There's only so much I can do for you
After all of the things you've put me through

I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing till dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out


I know you're scared, I can feel it
It's in the air, I know you feel that too
But take a chance on me
You won't regret it, no

One more "No" and I'll believe you
I'll walk away and I will leave you be
And that's the last time you'll say no, say no to me

It won't take me long to find another lover, but I want you
I can't spend another minute getting over loving you

If you don't ever say yeah
Let me hear you say yeah
Wanna hear you say yeah yeah yeah
Till my heart is open
Now you're gonna say yeah
Let me hear you say yeah
Wanna hear you say yeah yeah yeah
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Yes yes yes yes yes yes
Yes yes yes yes yes

It's just a moment go and seize it
Don't be afraid to give your heart to me
And if you do, I know that I won't let you down, no
Yeah, so hand it over, trust me with your love
I'll do anything you want me to
'Cause I can't breathe until I can see your face

Oh and I don't need time to find another lover, but I want you
I can't spend another minute getting over loving you

If you don't ever say yeah
Let me hear you say yeah
Wanna hear you say yeah yeah yeah
Till my heart is open
Now you're gonna say yeah
Let me hear you say yeah
Wanna hear you say yeah yeah yeah
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Yes yes yes yes yes yes


I have told 
All of my enemies 
Very polietly 
To go home 
I have seen 
All of your remedies 
Now won't you let me please 
Go home? 

I can't find anything to be sad about 
They say I'm doomed, but I feel fine 

I have tried 
So very hard as hell 
To stay away from hell 
And live upstairs 
But when I see 
All of your remedies 
I try quite desperately 
To go home 

I can't find anything to be sad about 
They say I'm doomed, but I feel fine 
But if I'm sitting here lonely with no one to hold me 
At least I'll have my health 
I'm trying to control myself 

I have told 
All of my enemies 
Very polietly 
To go home 
I have seen 
All of your remedies 
Now won't you let me please 
Go home? 

I've been acting irresponsibly 
But what could go possibly go wrong? 
I have choked on all your remedies 
Now won't you let me please 
Go home? 

But if I sit here lonely 
With no one to hold me 
At least I'll have my health 
I'm trying to control myself 

I'm trying to control 

Myself



You push me, I don't have the strength to
Resist or control you
So take me down
Take me down

You hurt me, but do I deserve this
You make me so nervous
Calm me down
Calm me down

Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
I will never walk away again
I never gonna leave this bed

So come here and never leave this place
Perfection of your face
Slows me down
Slows me down
So fall down I need you to trust me
Go easy, don't rush me

Help me out why don't you help me out

Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
I will never walk away again
I never gonna leave this bed
You say go
It isn't worth it and I say no
It isn't perfect so I stay and still
I'm never gonna leave this bed uh

Take it, take it all take all that I have
I'd give it all away just to get you back
And fake it, fake it I'll take what I can get
Knocking so loud, can you hear me yet?
Try to stay awake but you can't forget

Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed
Oh, you say go
It isn't worth it and I say no
It isn't perfect so I stay and still
I'm never gonna leave this bed uh

Take it, take it all take all that I have
Take it, take it all take all that I have
Take it, take it all take all that I have
Take it, take it all take all that I have
Take it, take it all take all that I have
Take it, take it all take all that I have
Take it, take it all take all that I have


I'll be your Sunday moon tonight
I can be your whatever you like, ooh
I was alone but I met it a few
I wanna show you my feelings are real, yeah
All this time I've been living it up
And every night I'd be falling in love, ooh
But I'm finally seeing the light
Falling in love with you every night, yeah

But if I ever let you down
If I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me, now
Would it kill you to forgive me now
But if I ever let you down
If I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me, now
Would it kill you to forgive me
This is a new love
This is a new love
This is a new love
Would it kill you to forgive me

What the fuck, I got nothing to lose
I'm a slave to the way that you move, ooh
I'm an addict for all that you do
You're the only drug I wanna do yeah
I can tell that you're needing my love
And all I want is to give it to you, ooh
Don't give up on the moment tonight
You'll regret it the rest of your life

But if I ever let you down
If I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me, now
Would it kill you to forgive me now
But if I ever let you down
If I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me, now
Would it kill you to forgive me
This is a new love

Would it kill you to forgive me

I still don't get it
'Cause if you don't know it yet
You'll know that I'm not your enemy, your enemy yeah
'Cause I know I lie
And it wouldn't kill you child
Won't go until you've forgiven me, forgiven me
Till you forgiven me, forgiven me, forgiven me

But if I ever let you down

This is a new love
This is a new love
This is a new love
Would it kill you to forgive me


You say you need someone
But everybody does
I'm no different than you
I just believe what I do

You point your finger at
Everyone but yourself
And blame the ones that you love
Who are only trying to help

As it's winding down to zero
I am yours like a hero
I'll see this through
There's so much me and you
Take this enemy together
Fight these demons off forever forever forever forever

Five, four, three, two, one I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all

I have no time for fear
Or people in my ear
Head down and running so fast
Try not to dwell on the past

I'm fighting through this pain
And things I cannot change
Running right into the flame
Rather than running away

As it's winding down to zero
I am yours like a hero
I'll see this through
There's so much me and you
Take this enemy together
Fight these demons off forever forever forever forever

Five, four, three, two, one I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all

Sweat drips down from every angle
Love your body as it gathers in a pool by your feet
You turn up the heat
Tossing and turning,  you cannot sleep
Quietly weep, you're in too deep

Five, four, three, two, one I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all

Five, four, three, two, one I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all


When you refuse me
You confuse me
What makes you think I'll let you in again
Think again, my friend
Go on, misuse me and abuse me
I'll come out stronger in the end

And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown

When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me cause I'm not coming home

You do not know how much this hurts me
To say these things that I don't want to say
But I have to say them anyway
I would do anything to end your suffering
But you would rather walk away

And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown

When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me cause I'm not coming home

And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown

Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone
Does it make you mad
To find that I have grown
Bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown

When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me cause I'm not coming home

When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me cause I'm not coming home

When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me cause I'm not coming home


Danced all night, and slept all day
Careless with my heart again
Fearless when it comes to playing games

You don't cry, and you don't care
Afraid to have a love affair
Is that your ghost or are you really there?

Now, I can't walk
I can't talk anymore since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart

Weather on a sunny day
Time slows down; I wish you'd stay
Pass me by in crowded, dark hallways
Mmm

I try my hardest not to scream
I find my heart is growing weak
So leave your reasons on the bathroom sink

Now, I can't walk
I can't talk anymore since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart

I heard you say you needed me now
What's the problem? I can't see
You destroyed me; I won't fall apart again
I'm not falling apart

Take what you wanted
I will be just fine
You will be better off alone at night
Waiting and falling
Constantly calling out your name
Will it ever change?

Now, I can't walk
I can't talk anymore since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart

I heard you say you needed me now
What's the problem? I can't see
You destroyed me; I won't fall apart again
I'm not falling apart

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


It is so easy to see
Dysfunction between you and me
We must free up these tired souls
Before the sadness kills us both

I tried and tried to let you know
I love you, but I'm letting go
It may not last, but I don't know
I just don't know

If you don't know
Then you can't care
And you show up
But you're not there
But I'm waiting
And you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you

Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever; but be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

A bed that's warm with memories
Can heal us temporarily
The misbehaving only makes
The ditch between us so damn deep

Built a wall around my heart
I'll never let it fall apart
But, strangely, I wish secretly
It would fall down while I'm asleep

If you don't know
Then you can't care
And you show up
But you're not there
But I'm waiting
And you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you, babe

Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever; but be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

Though we have not hit the ground
It doesn't mean we're not still falling, oh
I want so bad to pick you up
But you're still too reluctant to accept my help
What a shame; I hope you find somewhere to place the blame
But until then the fact remains...

Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever; but be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever; but be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way


Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh

You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the door
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we start keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah I know that we can't do this no more

But baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

Try to tell you no but my body keeps on telling you yes
Try to tell you stop but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up feeling satisfied but guilty as hell

But baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
And I stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

Yeah baby give me one more night
Yeah baby give me one more night
Yeah baby give me one more night

Baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
And I stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night
(Yeah baby give me one more night)

So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night


Tell me actions speak louder
But there's something about her words, that hurt
Closing up and it's so late and
I'm the last one still waiting for ya, to lock the door

On our way home I realize
There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes
Only veiled by a thin disguise

Now that I've done my time
I need to move on and I need you to try
'Cause we're out of goodbyes
We're out of goodbyes, out of goodbyes

Never asked you to change
But sadly you don't feel the same, about me
I wonder does your man still shudder when you touch his hand
Like this man

On our way home I realize
There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes
Only veiled by a thin disguise

Now that I've done my time
I need to move on and I need you to try
'Cause we're out of goodbyes
We're out of goodbyes, we're out of goodbyes, we're out of goodbyes
Oh, ooh


I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me

You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two

If Happy Ever Afters did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick

Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away

You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights,
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

If Happy Ever Afters did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone

Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunting
And all of my cars start with a push of a button

Telling me the chances I blew up
Or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it I'm ballin'

Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take
That little piece of shit with you

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two

If Happy Ever Afters did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone


Hotter than the hesitation
Was the way you looked around then
Acting like some older woman you moved in
Pinned me to the ground I couldn't stop you
Making my imagination jealous of
A picture perfect situation

She has got me locked up tighter than I thought
She's a quick licking pleasure sucker
Hotter than a motherfucker
And she knows who she is
And she gives me whatever I want

I, retire to my room
Think of her as my vacation from myself
As she goes off with someone else
I sit (here) alone in desperation
Contemplating masturbation
I lean back serious slacka, heart attack

She has got me locked up hotter than I thought
She's a quick licking pleasure sucker
Hotter than a motherfucker

She has got me locked up hotter than I thought
She's a quick licking pleasure sucker
Hotter than a motherfucker

Ohhhh
She has got me locked up tighter than I thought
She's a quick licking pleasure sucker
Hotter than a motherfucker
And she knows who she is
And she gives me whatever I want

She has got me locked up tighter than I thought
She's a quick licking pleasure sucker
Hotter than a motherfucker
And she knows who she is
And she gives me whatever I want


Come with me, and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see into your imagination

We'll begin with a spin
Traveling in the world of my creation
What we'll see will defy explanation

If you want to view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Want to change the world, there's nothing to it

There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there, you'll be free
If you truly wish to be

If you want to view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Want to change the world, there's nothing to it

[Come with me, and you'll be]
[In a world of pure imagination]

There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there, you'll be free
If you truly wish to be


Rag Doll
How ya feelin'?
The day has had its way with both of us
And no, I've gone out of my way
But I'm not free
From this pain I'm reelin'
I was a fool to think some day you would come around
But no no no I'm not thinking that way
'Cause now I see

You are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me
Sometimes I just wanna scream

I think you should just go away cause
There's no necessity for you to stay and
Next time you come around my way
Forget it baby your not comin' in

How's your day been?
'Cause mine has taken strange and ugly turns
But no no no I feel better today
'Cause I'm off my knees

You are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me
Sometimes I just wanna scream

I think you should just go away cause
There's no necessity for you to stay and
Next time you come around my way
Forget it baby your not comin' in

A heart made for a lot of sorrow
No you can't come back tomorrow
Shut my windows, lock my doors
'Cause my heart won't be your rag doll anymore
Yeah

I think you should just go away cause
there's no necessity for you to stay and
Next time you come around my way
Forget it baby your not comin' in

A heart made for a lot of sorrow
No you can't come back tomorrow
Shut my windows, lock my doors
'Cause my heart won't be your rag doll anymore
Whoa


What am I supposed to do with this time
It tears so many holes, I stay afloat but I'm
Feel out of control, so petrified
I'm petrified

What am I supposed to do to get by
Did I lose everything I need to survive
'Cause its 4 a.m. and the sweat sets in
Did you get my message, did it send
Or did you just get on with your life, oh

I've taken time to think and I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally found the words to say
But I can't tell you
If you turn around and run away, run away

What am I supposed to do with these clothes
It's my twisted way of keep you close
I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a broken man
Did you get my message, did it send
Or do you get along on your own, oh

I've taken time to think and I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally found the words to say
But I can't tell you
If you turn around and run away, run away

And it breaks me down when I see your face
You look so different but you feel the same
And I do not understand, I cannot comprehend
The chills your body sends, why did it have to end

I've taken time to think and I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling that I
Finally found the words to say
But I can't tell you
If you turn around and run away, run away

I've taken time to think and I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
And I have this feeling that I
Finally found the words to say
But I can't tell you
If you turn around and run away, run away

Runaway, runaway
Turn around and runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
But I can't tell you if you runaway, runaway
Turn around and runaway


Man, it's been a long day
Stuck thinking 'bout it driving on the freeway
Wondering if I really tried everything I could
Not knowing if I should try a little harder

Ooh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread
I'm kicking the curb 'cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have
I'm so sad, sad

Man, it's been a long night
Just sitting here trying not to look back
Still looking at the road we never drove on
And wondering if the one I chose was the right one

Ooh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread
I'm kicking the curb 'cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have
I'm so sad, sad

So sad, so sad

Ooh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread
I'm kicking the curb 'cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have

And I'm kicking the curb 'cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
I'm so sad, so sad


Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes
Off we go
Some conversation
No contemplation
Hit the road

Car overheats
Jump out of my seat
On the side of the highway, baby
Our road is long
Your hold is strong
Please don't ever let it go, oh no

I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh, can they keep it
Oh, no they can't

Driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
Where you at now
I feel around
There you are

Cool these engines
Calm these jets
I ask you, how hot can it get?
As you wipe off beads of sweat
Slowly, you say, I'm not there yet

I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh, can they keep it
Oh, no they can't

I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh, no they can't


Hanging 'round downtown by myself

Beauty queen of only eighteen she
Had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her, she
Always belonged to someone else

I drove for miles and miles and wound up
At your door
I've had you so many times but somehow I want more

I don't mind spendin' everyday
Out on your corner in the pourin' rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved, and she will be loved

Tap on my window, knock on my door, I
Want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along yeah
My heart is full, and my door's always open
You can come anytime you want yeah

I don't mind spendin' everyday
Out on your corner in the pourin' rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved, and she will be loved
And she will be loved, and she will be loved

I know where you hide alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and makes me catch her every time she
Falls

Yeah, tap on my window, knock on my door, I
Want to make you feel beautiful

I don't mind spendin' everyday
Out on your corner in the pourin' rain oh
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved, and she will be loved
And she will be loved, and she will be loved

Please don't try so hard to say good-bye
I don't mind spendin' everyday, out on your corner in the pourin' rain
Please don't try so hard to say good-bye


You build me up
You knock me down
Provoke a smile
And make me frown
You are the queen of runaround
You know it's true

You chew me up
And spit me out
Enjoy the taste
I leave in your mouth
You look at me
I look at you
Neither of us know what to do

There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when i hear your name
Think about you but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin

Immobilized by the thought of you
Paralyzed by the sight of you
Hypnotized by the words you say
Not true but I believe 'em anyway

So come to bed it's getting late
There's no more time for us to waste
Remember how my body tastes
You feel you heart being to race


Yeah you gotta let it go
'Cause we're losing grip now
It's about to go down
Would you let me talk to you, you
You gotta let me know
'Cause I'm on the edge now
Of a nervous breakdown
'Cause I can't get through to you

I got my hands up screaming
Got my hands up screaming
Don't shoot love baby
Don't shoot love
Don't shoot love baby
Don't shoot
When you get that feeling
When you get that feeling
Don't shoot love baby
Don't shoot love
Don't shoot love baby
Don't shoot

Yeah you never let me go
Got me chained to your touch
Like a slave for your love
I'm ashamed to say it's true, oh
Afraid to let you go
'Cause without you I'm lost
And no matter the cost
I'm standing next to you, oh

I got my hands up screaming
Got hands up screaming
Don't shoot love baby
Don't shoot love
Don't shoot love baby
Don't shoot
When you get that feeling
When you get that feeling
Don't shoot love baby
Don't shoot love
Don't shoot love baby
Don't shoot

My back's against the world tonight
So go ahead pull the trigger
Shoot the lights out
Go ahead pull the trigger
Shoot the lights out
I see the fear that's in your eyes
So go ahead pull the trigger
Shoot the lights out
Go ahead pull the trigger
Shoot

I got my hands up screaming
Got my hands up screaming
Don't shoot love baby
Don't shoot love
Don't shoot love baby
Don't shoot
When you get that feeling
When you get that feeling
Don't shoot love baby
Don't shoot love
Don't shoot love baby
Don't shoot


Leaning on a tree trunk,
thinking all the same junk
fallin in and out of a dream, 
back and forth I'm swaying, 
I'm contemplating staying, 
Laying and decaying 
when I know I must leave

Where do I aim when I shoot the breeze?
How do I calm myself at times like theses?

I need a simple kind of lovely and the thought is just a novelty

You can spend the whole time
Dangling from a grape vine
Standing underneath you
When they cut you free
What about when the sun leaves?
And what about all those bad dreams?
Who will walk you back into reality?
I wish things could be like this everyday
But I know that I could never live this way

It was just a simple kind of lovely
And the memories will be ok

The memories will be ok
Memories will be ok 


Do you mean all the things you are?
Are you pleased with the way things are?
Wear that dress to protect this scar
That only I have seen

Do you give just to please yourself?
Do you wish you were somewhere else?
Justified all the things you tried
Said that it was all for me

And be near
Just for the moment
Stay here
Never go home

Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true
It comes true

Have you learned all the secrets yet?
Will you burn by the things I've said?
Took the dive just to feel alive
But never heard the truth

Now I'm in love but I don't know how
I'm in pain cause I want it now
As I sit watching her eyes close
I slowly open mine

And be near
Just for the moment
Stay here
Never go home

Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true, comes true

I am so confused by this
I know that life is hit or miss
Days are stung by too much sun
I think that you may be the one

Cover yourself up in me
Shrouded in what could have been
I will listen to your pain
If you listen to me

Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
So it goes, as the story of a broken heart comes true,
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?
And I know, the story of a broken heart comes true
Come true
True
It comes true
True


I really, I really
Oh, I really need to know

Oh, or else you gotta let me go

Sinking under
Sinking under

It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I'll give you everything
Give some attention to me
All I want is just you and me always

I'm hurting, baby, I'm broken down
I need your loving, loving, I need it now
When I'm without you
I'm something weak
You got me begging
Begging, I'm on my knees

I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away
Ooh, baby,
'Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

Your sugar
Yes, please
Won't you come and put it down on me
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love and little sympathy
Yeah you show me good loving
Make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar
Yes, please
Won't you come and put it down on me

My broken pieces
You pick them up
Don't leave me hanging, hanging
Come give me some
When I'm without ya
I'm so insecure
You are the one thing
The one thing, I'm living for

I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away
Ooh, baby,
'Cause I really don't care where you are

Unless that somebody's me

There ain't no other way
'Cause girl you're hotter than southern California Bay

I don't wanna play no games

Don't give all that shy shit
No make up on, that's my

Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you

That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you.
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
Driving slow

It's flower in your hair
I'm a flower in your hair


Where you are seems to be
As far as an eternity
Outstretched arms, open hearts
And if it never ends then when do we start?
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back
I have some things to say

How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I

Dream away everyday
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart

I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back
I have some things to say

How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel




Where you are seems to be

As far as an eternity

Outstretched arms open hearts

And if it never ends then when do we start?

I'll never leave you behind

Or treat you unkind

I know you understand

And with a tear in my eye

Give me the sweetest goodbye

That I ever did receive


Pushing forward and arching back

Bring me closer to heart attack

Say goodbye and just fly away

When you comeback

I have some things to say


How does it feel to know you never have to be alone

When you get home

There must be someplace here that only you and I could go

Dream away everyday

Try so hard to disregard

The rhythm of the rain that drops

Give me the sweetest goodbye

That I ever did receive

I woke up this morning with the burden of love hanging over my head as I
Walked into the living room
Sit with you, discuss whats going on
Is it me?
Is it you?
Is it something I forgot to do?
Tell me so that I understand

I just need some time
Gather all my thoughts
To make up for the love I just lost
You've been so good to me, given me everything
Take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me

I woke up this morning with the hurting that I would never ever wish upon
Even my worst enemy
Who is she, what the hell do you people want?
Is it me?

Is it you?
Is it something I forgot to do?
Tell me so that I understand

I just need some time
Gather all my thoughts
To make up for the love I just lost
You've been so good to me given me everything
Take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me anyway

I just need some time
Gather all my thoughts
To make up for the love I just lost
You've been so good to me given me everything
Take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me


I'm full of regret
For all the things that I have done and said
And I don't know if it'll ever be okay to show
My face 'round here
Sometimes I wonder if I disappear

Would you ever turn your head and look
To see if I'm gone
'Cause I fear

There is nothing left to say to you
That you want to hear
That you want to know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful

You're just an innocent
A helpless victim of a spider's web
And I'm an insect
Going after anything that I can get
So you'd better turn your head and run
And don't look back
Cause I fear

There is nothing left to say to you
That you want to hear
That you want to know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful

And I have done you so wrong
Treated you bad
Strung you along
Oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up
'Cause I fear

There is nothing left to say to you
That you want to hear
That you want to know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful


She was a bad thing comin'
But I did not know
And everytime I came over, she told me I had to go
I said, "Hey, what's goin' on?
I really wanna know!"
She said, "I cannot tell you now
But I'll call you tomorrow."

That's not enough
I want more
I want it all
I want to bang on your front door
Turn off the lights and shut out the world
Cause at the end of the day
Aren't we all just boys and girls?

Woah, she slayed me with sophistication
So much class!
She drinks a Santa Margarita
Would you like a glass?
I don't know how to say, "No"
and after three or four
I was on the floor singin' my songs
"La la la, no no"

That's not enough
I want more
I want it all
I want to bang on your front door
Turn off the lights and shut out the world
Cause at the end of the day
Aren't we all just boys and girls?

La la la, no no

That's not enough
I want more
I want it all
I want to bang on your front door
Turn off the lights and shut out the world
Cause at the end of the day
Aren't we all just boys and girls? (x5)


People never change,
They seem to stay the same.
They wear different clothes,
But play the same games.

Many different ways
To say the same thing.
Searchin for the right words,
The ones that would make you stay.

Exchanging the way things were
For they way that they should be,
Yeah.
And choosing theses words
Is saying to her,
The things that she never heard
But always deserved.

I figured what it is all about.
It's you that I could never live without.
Your everything,
The air that I breathe.
Stupid not to know it all along,
And everything I ever did was wrong.
Sadly it's too late for sorry.

Oh I'm not even really sure
Who made this mess,
And who threw what punch,
But I could not care less.
All I know is that I'm here
And you are not, Ohhh.
Once I put this wasted pride aside,
Nothin's all I got, Ohhh.

Exchanging the way things were
For they way that they should be,
Yeah.
And choosing theses words
Is saying to her,
The things that she never heard
But always deserved.

I figured what it is all about.
It's you that I could never live without.
Your everything,
The air that I breathe.
Stupid not to know it all along,
And everything I ever did was wrong.
Sadly it's too late for sorry.

Ohh,
Somebody make it stop.
Yeahh.
And pick me up, 
And just dust me off, Ohh.
The rainy day flood,
Will drowned all this love.
Trapped at the bottom now,
Please dig me up.

I figured what it is all about.
It's you that I could never live without.
Your everything,
The air that I breathe.
Stupid not to know it all along,
And everything I ever did was wrong.
Sadly it's too late for sorry.

I figured what it is all about.
It's you that I could never live without.
Your everything,
The air that I breathe.
Stupid not to know it all along,
And everything I ever did was wrong.
Sadly it's too late for sorry.


Here in this town they have all got the blues
As the paperboy takes off without any news
Angels have wings you can feel free to use
The corner store drugs you can freely abuse

And i'm yelling and screaming cause 
Baby you're driving me crazy

So life on your own has been vacant and cold
Everyone's getting somewhere and you're getting old
Career opportunities, they all have been sold
Along with your body, and most of your soul

And i'm yelling and screaming cause 
Baby you're driving me crazy

If i could spare more remorse
From my emptied out pores
I would maybe

[chorus]
Cause the fog's getting thicker
The world's spinning fast
The chaos is building
It's going to last
And it's so hard to see
And you're so hard to find
They're days when i think i am losing my mind

So keep painting pictures of beautiful scenes
Striking the canvas with deep blues and greens
Realists are frowning, they think you're obscene
As you work overtime to make sure they can dream

And i'm yelling and screaming cause 
Baby you're driving me crazy

If i could spare more remorse
From my emptied out pores
I would maybe

[chorus]

And we yell
And we scream

[chorus 2x] 


Every day, people sway 
softly lulling me to sleep 
I look the other way 
but I still can't look too deep 
I think I'll fall asleep 
I think I'll fall asleep 

So call up and tell him that you will survive 
good looking kid with the velvet eyes 
you and me and everything's gonna be fine 

Every night, people fight 
gently lulling me to sleep 
what gives me the right 
to waste away and weep 
I think I'll turn away 
there's nothing left to say 

So call up and tell him that you will survive 
good looking kid with the velvet eyes 
you and me and everything's gonna be fine 
so you wanna have everything your heart desires 
there's a fist full of people with their hearts on fire 
make your way on up to the front of the line 

Get out of my way 
I'm here now to stay 
Get out of my way 
I'm here now to stay 

So call up and tell him that you will survive 
good looking kid with the velvet eyes 
you and me and everything's gonna be fine 
so you wanna have everything your heart desires 
there's a fist full of people with their hearts on fire 
make your way on up to the front of the line


In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard
Screaming at each other, screaming at each other
Like oh oh oh, can't take it anymore
Like a tragedy, like a dark comedy
Laughing at each other, laughing at each other
Like, oh oh oh it isn't funny anymore

I was the man who never lied
I never lied until today
But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday
I was the man who never lied, oh
I was the man who never lied, oh yeah

Sometimes honesty is the worst policy
Happy ever after, happy ever after
Let it go, you never need to know
I don't wanna be picking up all of these
Tiny little pieces, tiny little pieces
Of your heart, won't do it anymore

I was the man who never lied
I never lied until today
But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday
I was the man who never lied, oh
I was the man who never lied, oh

I was the
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh

In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard
What am I doing in Hollywood Boulevard?
In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard
Screaming at each other, screaming

I was the man who never lied
I never lied until today
But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday

I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday
I was the man who never lied, oh (oh I was the man)
I was the man who never lied, oh yeah (I was the man oh yeah)


After school
Walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
Trying to recreate images life gives us from our past

And sometimes it's a sad song

But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And Mama I've been cryin'
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, "The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun."

Moving on down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
Think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps

And sometimes it's a sad song

But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And Mama I've been cryin'
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, "The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun."

The rhythm of her conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
And on and on and on and on

But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And Mama I've been cryin'
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, "The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the sun."


Making love to a picture frame
One more time tonight
You can tell by the lines in her smile
Something is not right

Where are you hiding (hiding)
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying (crying)
Just another crazy boy
Hungry for your

Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a
Warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I'm
Filled up
Never need to
Go back to the way I was
The way I was

I tried and tried and tried and tried
But I have no concept of consequence
And I'm a master of self defense
Days get longer
Life gets shorter
She rips me like no other
So oh dripping from head to toe

Where are you hiding (hiding)
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying (crying)

Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a
Warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I'm
Filled up
Never need to
Go back to the way I was
The way I was

Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a
Warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I'm
Filled up
Never need to
Go back to the way I was
The way I was

I can't make the same mistake
If you lose my love
It was yours to take
Break down your door
Take a little more
When I need you around

And I'm so terrified of leaving
It's a new low
Try and pick me up again but
Let go see how far I get without you
Desperately need more of your

Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a
Warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I'm
Filled up
Never need to
Go back to the way I was
The way I was

Hot love
Wrap yourself around me like a
Warm glove
The emptiness leaves me and I'm
Filled up
Never need to
Go back to the way I was
The way I was


Some day, when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight

Yes, you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
And the way you look tonight

With each word your tenderness grows
Tearin' my fear apart
And that laugh wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

Lovely, never, ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it? Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight

And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
It touches my foolish heart

Lovely, don't you ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it? Cause I love you
a-just the way you look tonight

Mm, Mm Mm, Mm,
Just the way you look tonight


I was so high, I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore, woah, woah, woah

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Oh, kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

But, oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore woah, woah, woah

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything is alright
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
My heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore


This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker

Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not, no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something

I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker

She wants it all
She's always taking something
And now I'm left with nothing
I'm ripping off, oh
I'm ripping off that bandage
Because I just can't stand it

I see her dancing on a fool
Like she's seventeen and cool
She really thinks that she can move
But it's just nasty
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker

Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular
Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular, oh

This summer's gonna hurt
It's gonna hurt

I see her dancing in the street
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
'Cause she's so fancy

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker


Can you see me
Floating above your head
As you lay in bed
Thinking about everything
That you did not do
Cause saying I love you
Has nothing to do with meaning it

And I don't trust you
Cause every time you're here
Your intentions are unclear
I spend every hour waiting for a phone call
That I know will never come
I used to think you were the one
Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all

You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

Do you remember
The way we used to melt
Do you remember how it felt
When I touched you
Cause I remember very well

And how long has it been
Since someone you let in
Has given when I gave to you

And at night when you sleep
Do you dream I would be there
Just for a minute or two
Do you

You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

Heartache, heartache I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
There is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through with you


She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow

It's funny how you say that you made it on your own
When you haven't worked for anyone your daddy didn't know
You say you got a job, but I don't know what you do
Such a f***ing snob that you'll never know the truth

You're perfect on the outside, but nothing at the core
It's easy to forget when you show up at my door
Stop messing with my mind, 'cause you'll never have my heart
But your perfect little body makes me fall apart
Your perfect little body makes me fall apart

She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow

La la la la la la la la la la la la

I know you wanna stay, but I think that you should go
'Cause you've got nothing to say, you just sit there on your phone
I try not to give in, but temptation has me lost
So I will do my best to get you off

You're perfect on the outside, but nothing at the core
It's easy to forget when you show up at my door
Stop messing with my mind 'cause you'll never have my heart
But your perfect little body makes me fall apart
Your perfect little body makes me fall apart

She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow

Yeah, she's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow

She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la


See my dear I'm thinking of you
My how she has grown
her building blocks have all gone home
And being there is always where
I'll be
You'll see

Take your doll
House dreams and make them real
I've seen the sun
I'll guide your
inspirations along
And don't let them stop you from being someone's friend
Don't bend

I hope you
always keep your hand this close to mine
And I hope you
never hesitate to wonder why
Wonder why
Wonder why
If you need a shoulder mine is here
And I love you
And no one can tell you what to do
And roses and diamonds could never take
the place
of your face
I hope you
never hesitate to wonder why
wonder why
wonder why

If you respect me
Don't protect me
You can tell me, I can handle it
Stop pretending, 'cause we're going down
If you let go, then just let go
It's disrespectful how you've handled this
Never ending, kinda run around

I lie to my heart 'cause I thought you felt it
You can't light a fire, if the candle's melted
No you don't have to love me
If you don't wanna
Don't act like I mean nothing
But if you're gonna
Well, when you're better off

Unkiss me, untouch me
Untake this heart
And I'm missing
Just one thing
A brand new star

Can't erase this, can't delete this
I don't need this, I can't handle it
I just feel it, that you're over us
If I wait here, if I see you
It won't matter, what's the point of this?
We're in pieces, because you're over us, oh

I lie to my heart 'cause I thought you felt it
You can't light a fire, if the candle's melted
No you don't have to love me
If you don't wanna
Don't act like I mean nothing
But if you're gonna
Well, when you're better off

Unkiss me, untouch me
Untake this heart, yeah yeah
And I'm missing
Just one thing
A brand new star
So unkiss me
So unkiss me, yeah, yeah yeah

So baby let go
Gotta let go
It's disrespectful, I can't handle this
Never ending, kinda run around

Yeah, unkiss me, untouch me
Untake this heart, oh no no no no
And I'm missing (I'm missing)
Just one thing
A brand new star
So unkiss me
So unkiss me
Unkiss me


This relationship is over,
Though my stomach still hurts
And now I'm gonna live alone,
Why is the pain much worse?
You're so much better without makeup,
Why would you hide your face?
Don't want to spend the night and wake up,
Realize I've made a big mistake

I can not refuse your eyes,
Please don't look at me tonight
My heart beats fast I know you're there,
And I pretend like I don't care
It hurts so bad to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you

I never meant to keep you waiting,
And now your food is getting cold,
I keep denying I'm in love with you,
My routine is getting old
And now you stand in front of the table,
And say you never look back
Your super stupid when you're angry,
You only wake up sad

I can not refuse your eyes,
Please don't look at me tonight
My heart beats fast I know you're there,
And I pretend like I don't care
It hurts so bad to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you

It hurts too much to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you

No more kisses on your lips, tender touch oh please,
I'd rather die on my two feet than live down on my knees
And you're the girl to get me over what we start to be
And I just cant get over you, and until you're over me

I can not refuse your eyes,
Please don't look at me tonight
My heart beats fast I know you're there,
And I pretend like I don't care

I can not refuse your eyes,
Please don't look at me tonight
My heart beats fast I know you're there,
And I pretend like I don't care
It hurts so bad to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you

It hurts too much to know the truth,
But I am still in love with you


I didn't hear what you were saying
I live on raw emotion, baby
I answer questions, never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me
So, who the hell are you to save me?
I never would have made it, babe

If you needed love
Well, then, ask for love
Could have given love
Now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault
'Cause you both deserve
What's coming now
So don't say a word

Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me?
I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here?
I don't think so

Would have bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you beat me at my own game
And now I'm finally sleeping soundly
And your lover's screaming loudly
I hear a sound and hit the ground

If you needed love
Well, then, ask for love
Could have given love
Now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault
'Cause you both deserve
What's coming now
So don't say a word

Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me?
I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here?
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad

I'm so sorry, darling
Did I do the wrong thing?
Oh, what was I thinking?
Is his heart still beating?

Whoa, oh, oh

Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me?
I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here?
I don't feel so bad

Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me?
I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore, no
He won't come around here?
I don't feel so bad

(Wake up call)
(Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed)
(Don't you care about me anymore?)
(Don't you care about me?)
(I don't feel so bad)
(Wake up call)
(Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed)
(Don't you care about me anymore)


Slow is the memory
I can picture her standing right in front of me
I said that I'm behaving badly
Kinda driving her crazy
But I know she wants me

I remember everything
Her sweat, it tastes like sugar cane
And sit on top of me, yelling out my fucking name
Until I'm empty
And I know she wants me

But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry
I'm sick of all these wasted years
Drown in someone else's tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry
Whoa, whoa, yeah yeah yeah yeah

And I'll see you when I get back
Maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track
You touch me there because you know how much I like that
I think that we both need to relax
You know you want me

All the time and everywhere
A happy surface but the underbelly isn't there
And the worst thing is that I don't even really care
And the emptiness is too much to bear

But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry
I'm sick of all these wasted years
Drown in someone else's tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry

'Cause sometimes I don't know what to do
I'm standing, standing right in front of you
And pray our pain subsides
Can't bare the stare of your teary eyes
I know you feel like it's hard to stay
In fact you may just wanna run away
Now all that I can really say is baby, oh
Deep down you know that

I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry
I'm sick of all these wasted years
Drown in someone else's tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry

I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry
Sick of all these wasted years
Drown in someone else's tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry

Oh no no no
Oh no no no
(We tried, yeah)

I'm afraid that I gotta do what I gotta do
But if I let you go, where you gonna go?
We gotta make a change, time to turn the page
Something isn't right, I don't wanna fight you
We've been through tougher times, you know it gets worse
We can turn this around please let me be first
And as I feel your tears spilling on my shirt
Something isn't right I don't wanna fight you

Hey you, come over and let me embrace you
I know that I'm causing you pain too
But remember if you need to cry
I'm here to wipe your eyes

Tonight before you fall asleep
I run my thumb across your cheek (across your cheek)
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (be okay)
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes

Oh nah nah oh nah nah nah nah
'Cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
Oh nah nah oh nah nah nah nah

When did we cross the line?
How could we forget?
Why do we let the pressure get into our heads?
Your broken heart requires all of my attention
'Cause something isn't right, I don't wanna fight you

Hey you, come over and let me embrace you
I know that I'm causing you pain too
But remember if you need to cry
I'm here to wipe your eyes

Tonight before you fall asleep
I run my thumb across your cheek (across your cheek)
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (be okay)
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes

Please don't lose your faith
Don't worry 'cause I'm here to keep you safe
I promise if you let me see your face
That I won't let you down
I won't let you down
I'm here to wipe your eyes

Tonight before you fall asleep
I run my thumb across your cheek (across your cheek)
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (be okay)
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes


If I'd be so inclined to climb up beside you
Would you tell me
That the time just isn't right
And if i ever find the key you hide so well
Will you tell me
That I can spend the night

Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand
What it is about this woman
Yeah ow wow

If I could bottle up the chills that you give me
I would keep them
In a jar next to my bed
And if i should ever draw a picture of a woman
It is you
That would come flowing through my pen

Leaving your clothes on the floor
Making me walk out the door
And i still fail to understand 
What it is about this woman
Ow

Helplessly melting 
As i stand next to the sun
As you burn me
I am screaming out for more
Drink every drop of liquid
In the heat that I've become
Pop me open 
Spoon me out onto the floor

Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand
Fail to understand

Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand
What it is about this woman
Yeah


I asked her to stay
But she wouldn't listen
And she left before I had the chance to say, oh
The words that would mend
The things that were broken
But now it's far too late; she's gone away

Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking: "Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
Hard to believe that

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

The taste of her breath
I'll never get over
The noises that you made kept me awake
Oh
The weight of the things that remained unspoken
Built up so much it crushed us everyday

Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking: "Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
Hard to believe that

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

Of all the things I felt but never really shown
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
I should not ever let you go, oh, oh, oh

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

Oh, oh, oh
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you
